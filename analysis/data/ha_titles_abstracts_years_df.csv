2021,Valdivia: Intercultural Relations along the Southern Frontier of the Spanish Empire in America during the Colonial Period (1552–1820),"This article presents a synthesis of regional archaeological investigations in the city and region of Valdivia during the colonial period (1550–1820). Previous studies have traditionally been centered on Hispanic mindsets and the role of conflict, the frontier status of colonial society in southern Chile, and the dispersed character of indigenous settlement. Here local sequences of material culture are reconsidered together with previous conceptual frameworks proposed by historical and anthropological research. Our research is based on new field surveys, the study of standing buildings, and assemblages of finds. These have been linked to different types of sites, including urban centers, fortifications, and mission posts. The results allow us to investigate the intercultural character of local society, settlement patterns, and the role of Valdivia in the context of the Peruvian viceroyalty and the Spanish Empire as a whole. Conclusions reveal the specific colonial processes that characterized the region and the sequence of founding, abandonment, and refounding of the urban center of Valdivia, which, in turn, impacted patterns of indigenous settlement and provoked technological hybridization in local ceramic industries. These changes can be linked to the emergence of an intercultural society, the definition of which proves more complex than that accepted by current binary categories."
2021,"The ca. 1638 Waterman Site, Marshfield, Massachusetts: The Anatomy of a Pilgrim House","The excavation and reconstruction of the ca. 1638 Waterman site is providing the first comprehensive and detailed look at the architecture and household material culture of an early period Pilgrim house in Plymouth Colony. The small vernacular house was of earth-fast, post-in-ground, and palisaded-wall construction, and burned down in a catastrophic fire after only a short period of occupation. The archaeological features, artifact patterns, and historical documents are integrated with 17th-century anthropomorphic architectural metaphors to reconstruct the house’s architecture and the various domestic activities that occurred within and around the house, including foodways, expressions of gender roles, environmental adaptation, and English and Native American cultural exchange."
2021,The First Cathedral on America’s Pacific Coast,"New research dispels the idea that Panamá Viejo was initially founded one-half mile from the site of its visible present-day ruins. The archaeological and historical evidence, subjected to interdisciplinary analysis, demonstrates that the city remained on the same main plaza next to its natural port from its founding 500 years ago until its destruction in 1671. The data reconsidered and newly uncovered also suggest reasons for previous misinterpretations of the city’s early foundational history. Unlike many colonial cities and towns, Panamá Viejo did not move during its first century of existence. However, its main church, which became the bishopric’s cathedral in 1524, did relocate after 1541. The new evidence establishes and confirms the original location of the first cathedral on America’s Pacific Ocean to the south of Panamá Viejo’s main plaza and explains its move to an elevated, rocky area on the eastern side of the same plaza over 20 years later. Excavations undertaken in 2018 have confirmed the original building’s location a mere 50 m from the visible ruins of the cathedral, the tower of which remains a symbol of Panamanian identity today."
2021,The Archaeology of Z: Household Economies in Nineteenth-Century Iceland,"A substantial and rapid increase in consumer goods has been detected in the archaeological record from Iceland during the 19th century. This article considers the impact of this change on household routines. Drawing inspiration from economics and Becker’s concept of Z commodities, the analysis seeks to blur the distinction between consumption and production by comparing the demands made on household resources by two different sets of tasks: firstly, those presented by the introduction of new materials related to coffee, and, secondly, those required by the traditional materials of butter production. The article illustrates the ways everyday routines are altered with the introduction of new materials and suggests that the productive work involved in consumption may be a key factor in how people and materials become entangled and mutually dependent."
2021,A Land of Plenty? Colonial Diet in Rural New Zealand,"Colonial New Zealand was built on the ideal of creating better lives for settlers. Emigrants came looking to escape the shackles of the class system and poor conditions in Industrial Revolution–period Britain. Colonial propaganda claimed that most emigrants achieved their aims, but the lives the colonists actually experienced upon reaching New Zealand remain relatively unexplored from a biosocial perspective. In this article we present a pilot study of stable-isotope test results of bone collagen from seven adults interred in St. John’s Cemetery, Milton, New Zealand (ca. 1860–1900). We interpret the diet at Milton and broadly compare our isotopic results with contemporaneous samples from Britain. We show that, as in contemporary Britain, the diet of our studied individuals was focused on C3 crops and terrestrial meat sources. Despite higher δ15N values in contemporary UK populations (which can be simplistically interpreted as indicative of higher meat intake), consideration of different local baselines makes it likely that this New Zealand population had relatively similar levels of meat intake. Interestingly, marine resources did not form an important part of the Milton diet, despite the site’s proximity to the ocean, hinting at the possible stigmatization of local resources and the development of a European New Zealand (pākehā) food identity."
2021,A Body Is Worth a Thousand Words: Early Colonial Dress-Scapes in Guam,"This article explores how dress became a fundamental “civilizing” item in the 17th-century Jesuit missionization of Guam, a small island in the western Pacific that was then inhabited by oral societies with low levels of socioeconomic complexity. The article analyzes the multiple dimensions of changing corporeal habits for native CHamoru people, and, most specifically, the interrelationships that arose from the construction of new selves, values, material culture, landscapes, labor, and technology in the configuration of new colonial “dress-scapes.” Forcible transition to dress and to alphabetic culture arrived at the island together as part of disciplinary processes that sought to “convert” CHamoru people to new lifeways and modes of being. Such processes were part of an engendered colonial transmodernity that initiated/accelerated a trend toward both similar understandings of the body and the ways it should be materially constituted and displayed."
2021,Reverse Engineering a Bronze Cannon from the La Belle Shipwreck,"The goal of this project was to scan and reverse engineer one of three bronze cannons (41MG86 - 11900-1) recovered from the La Belle excavation, which is currently on exhibit at the Bullock Texas State History Museum in Austin, Texas. A freeform computer aided design (CAD) model was generated based upon the topology of the three-dimensional (3-D) mesh in Geomagic Design X with a desired maximum deviation of 0.1 mm between the model and the mesh. Deviations were calculated in Geomagic Control X using the surface model as the reference data, and the mesh as the measured data. A custom patch network was subsequently designed using a series of iterative revisions until the whole of the surface model met with the specified tolerance. The 3-D surface model of the cannon will be replicated in a variety of media at variable scales for use in exhibits and for educational and promotional material for the Texas Historical Commission, the Republic of France, and their partner museums."
2021,Introduction: Studying Under-Floor Church Burials in Finland––Challenges in Stewarding the Past for the Future,"Two ongoing projects at the University of Oulu, Finland, are studying burials situated below the floorboards of Finnish churches. The projects examine mortality and materiality in Finland using an exceptionally well-preserved assemblage of mummified human remains. Multidisciplinary research methods, including CT scanning, μCT scanning, sampling for DNA and isotope analysis, and insect and plant samples, are providing multifaceted information concerning past societies. The samples provide rich insight into the material dimensions of mortality in northern Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since the studied material is located under the floors of church buildings that are still in use by congregations, obtaining permits for research and sampling has required managing relationships with separate parishes. This article outlines the projects and examines the ethical and legal dimensions of research on human remains conducted in partnership with individual parishes."
2021,Nikolaus Rungius: Lifestyle and Status of an Early Seventeenth-Century Northern Finnish Vicar,"Vicar Nikolaus Rungius’s (ca. 1560–1629) mummified remains have been the subject of research that has provided a wide variety of information on his life. This article examines the ways Rungius’s health and lifestyle highlight his status as a vicar, and this status is visible in his burial and funerary clothing. He was a relatively large man for his time. CT scans even include indications of certain conditions related to being overweight. Likewise, stable-isotope analyses of his nail keratin support the hypothesis that he was consuming a rather heavy, protein-rich diet. Given his status as the vicar of Kemi parish in northern Finland, he likely made sumptuous use of the rich local natural resources of fish, game, and domestic animals as part of his regular diet. In addition to his diet and health, the vicar’s high-quality clothes, while fragmentary, also open an avenue to extend the exploration of his social status and wealth."
2021,"Newborns, Infants, and Adolescents in Postmedieval Northern Finland: A Case Study from Keminmaa","Four coffins dating from the period between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries from Keminmaa in northern Ostrobothnian Finland were examined using computed-tomography (CT) scanning, a methodology with research applications for exploring human remains, coffins, and funerary textiles. The age and, in two cases, sex of the remains were estimated, and both historical sources and archaeological material suggest that socialization through gender was apparent in this collection. This article explores both the material testimony of care, dedication, and innocence of newborn and infant burials, as well as the socialization process and role of women adolescents in providing children’s funerary materials."
2021,Textiles: Decay and Preservation in Seventeenth- to Nineteenth-Century Burials in Finland,"The taphonomy of human remains and associated funerary textiles are inevitably linked. The interplay among burial clothes, human remains, insects, rodents, and preservation is explored through study of a group of postmedieval burials in Finland. These burials have been either archaeologically excavated or inventoried beneath wooden church floors. Decay and preserving factors for various conditions are studied, allowing in-depth study of individual garments and identification of the burial season. In addition, research has revealed different factors that have an effect on future preservation of the burials under church floors."
2021,The Materiality of Odors: Experiencing Church Burials and the Urban Environment in Early Modern Northern Sweden,"Archaeological material from early modern Sweden reveals that material and social meaning was intertwined in townscape odors; that is, odors and their association with unhygienic conditions affected the physical structure of the town, its material culture, and different traditions in the use of “townspace.” During the latter half of the 18th century, the town of Oulu suffered from unpleasant smells related to ponds and wet areas, and the odor of decomposing flesh from under-floor church burials greeted church visitors, despite the tradition of placing fragrant plants inside coffins. In the 18th century the town underwent deliberate changes: the ponds were drained and filled, burials under the church floor were prohibited, and one of the first graveyards located outside the town and separate from the church was constructed. These actions to change the town’s “smellscape” reflect emergent notions of regularity and cleanliness related to the Age of Enlightenment."
2021,“Unwanted Guests”: Evidence of Parasitic Infections in Archaeological Mortuary Contexts,"Parasites have had a significant impact on the course of human history—parasites have caused the deaths of countless individuals, have resulted in the abandonment of settlements, and have even affected the outcome of wars. It is curious, therefore, that archaeologists, even those engaged in dialogues about health, well-being, and sanitation in past populations, have paid relatively little attention to the impact that parasites might have had on those populations. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore some of the impacts of parasites on relatively recent history, describe the development of the field of parasite studies in archaeology, and outline a variety of laboratory methods that can be used to identify evidence of parasites in archaeological samples. Perhaps once more archaeologists are aware of the importance of parasitological testing of archaeological remains, more informed interpretations of past population health, as it relates to parasitic disease, can be constructed."
2021,"Ethics and Practice in the Excavation, Examination, Analysis, and Preservation of Historical Mummified Human Remains","European perspectives on the study of human remains, particularly mummified individuals with associated material culture, highlight the multidisciplinary research potential of these rare discoveries. The diverse evidence associated with mummified remains offers unique potential to consider how the deceased was experienced over time. Scientific analyses reveal the complex taphonomic processes leading to the selective survival of tissue and cultural items. Medical approaches to mummies have been long established, but historical examples can combine cultural and historical sources with the palaeopathological to develop more nuanced understandings of disease and lifestyle, identifying both individual biographies and wider cultural trends in mortuary practice. Study of mummies raises ethical considerations similar to those for skeletonized remains, but given the greater recognition of their humanity, further social and religious considerations are relevant. Investigation needs to be set against the local legislation and the feelings of the mummies’ gatekeepers and, in some cases, their descendant communities."
2021,Failure and Colonialism in the North American Fur Trade: The View from Riverine Assemblages,"It is understandable that archaeologists studying the North American fur trade often do so through the excavation and analysis of terrestrial sites. This article takes an alternative approach, analyzing assemblages that resulted from canoe accidents. Recovered from eddies and rocky bottoms of the French and Winnipeg rivers in Ontario, Canada, these collections offer unique opportunities to consider new dimensions of these histories: acute examples of loss and failure. An exploratory comparison of river assemblages with terrestrial fur-trade collections reveals new information on the magnitude of such losses. We argue that these unique fur-trade assemblages demonstrate the need for less anthropocentric approaches in historical archaeology that place more emphasis on material affect and nonhuman energy flows (e.g., rivers). We explore this proposition further through close consideration of two of the most common artifact types in the river assemblages: axes and files. Closer attention to the material properties and affordances of these objects offers fresh perspectives on the ways in which materials infused and framed human social relations and capabilities, past and present."
2021,"Racialized Incorporation, Urban Irish America, and Cut-Sponge-Decorated Ceramics","The dominant ideology of the United States has stressed as a primary precept the nation’s willingness to accept and incorporate new peoples. Patriotic boosters have promoted the nation as the exemplary model of cultural pluralism and inclusion, but immigration has remained a topic of protracted debate. Controversy occurs because racial theory underpins America’s national ideology. The 19th-century Anglo-Saxon elite that governed, financed, and controlled the nation racialized many immigrant groups as inferior. Irish immigration to the United States in the decades following the Great Famine provides an example. A process of racialized incorporation is outlined, and an example is presented using archaeological remains from Albany, New York. Speculation is presented about the connection between racialized social position and cut-sponge-stamped ceramics."
2020,Black and White Beads in the African Diaspora,"African diaspora archaeology has its roots in American plantation archaeology of the 1960s and 1970s. One of the first artifacts recovered from these contexts was the simple blue glass bead, recognized by some as signifying retentions of African belief. Simultaneously emerging in the 1970s was the field of historical mortuary archaeology, in which graves of African Americans were treated as archaeological resources for the first time. When these graves were studied scientifically, greater emphasis was placed on the skeletal biology than associated grave goods, and a very different set of questions was explored. Combining these two fields, this study documents a heretofore unrecognized pattern of not blue, but black beads and white beads—almost exclusively associated with infants and women––and ties these color choices and demographic patterns to specific West African cultures and the underlying meanings of womanhood, marriage, fertility, birth, and protection."
2020,Honoring and Embodying the Mandate of Community-Accountable Archaeology: Perspectives from the Indo-Hispano/a Southwest,"The lack of diversity in the archaeological community is worsened by the sense of exclusivity created at the meeting of archaeological practice and descendant communities. The authors’ work, carried out in partnership with Indo-Hispano/a communities in New Mexico, attempts to counteract this steep gradient of inclusion through the incorporation, professionalization, and leadership of our research collaborators. Our work confronts historical paradigms denying the significance of late colonial and Mexican period community-making in the Southwest, bringing to light the problematic nature of prior historical silences for their propagation of essentialist notions of indigeneity. The dehistoricization of the Indo-Hispano/a political, social, and economic present can be combated by archaeologies that emphasize community priorities for the direction of research. Central to such commitments is an archaeological praxis which not only fully recognizes the political nature of the work, but translates that potential through a cooperative program of action and inclusion."
2020,From Alcatraz to Standing Rock: Archaeology and Contemporary Native American Protests (1969–Today),"Public and professional responses to the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests reveal a space where archaeologists can potentially connect past and present. Archaeology has already been applied to protests over labor conditions, environment destruction, and weapons proliferation in both the United States and United Kingdom. Extending that work to Native American protests raises awareness of the legacy of the broken treaties that underlie many of these actions. For example, the 1969–1971 occupation of Alcatraz Island is where contemporary Native American protest history often begins. A simple pushpin map of protests since then shows that the DAPL protest at Standing Rock was unique only in its extensive media coverage. Building greater awareness of these actions will improve the ways archaeologists carry out their compliance responsibilities and respond to an often-misinformed public. Working with tribal colleagues to identify protest sites would enhance existing efforts to protect ancient sites and reinforce the need for tribal input in evaluating impacts to its cultural landscapes."
2020,"Gender, Clothing Fasteners, and Dress Practices in Houston’s Freedmen’s Town, ca. 1880–1904","Between 1880 and 1904, African American residents of Freedmen’s Town in Houston, Texas, were buried in the Third New City Cemetery. Using an assemblage of clothing fasteners recovered during excavations of the cemetery, I attempt to identify patterns of use and to interpret the kinds of clothing ensembles represented among men and women. The main goal of this study is to discern potential gendered patterns of clothing-fastener use that could assist in analyzing similar data from other sites. A related, secondary focus of this research is the working-class, gendered identity of black Houstonians and the roles of consumerism and clothing within the context of a segregationist Southern city."
2020,"An Intersectional Archaeology of Women’s Reproductive Rights in Early Twentieth-Century Easton, Maryland","The early 20th century laid much of the basis for today’s landscape of reproductive politics. This article evaluates the reproductive landscape of Easton, Maryland, in the early 20th century, where the appearance of a ca. 1903 advertising booklet for Chichester’s English Pennyroyal Pills and children’s toys on the site of a white middle-class home raises questions about the ways intersections of race, class, and gender constrained reproductive choices amid segregation and the rise of both the birth-control and eugenics movements. An intersectional lens facilitates the exploration of these intersections at the household, neighborhood, and national levels to compare the reproductive realities for white and African American women in this period and the particular local manifestations of these realities."
2020,“Missing Cemeteries” and Structural Racism: Historical Maps and Endangered African/African American and Hispanic Mortuary Customs in Texas,"Historical cemeteries across the United States are endangered due to development, neglect, and vandalism. Cemeteries of historically oppressed groups, specifically African, African American, and Hispanic populations, are even more susceptible to destruction or damage due to systematic, institutionalized racism; neglect; segregation; and unique mortuary patterns that often result in these cemeteries being ignored, damaged, or “lost.” A specific example is provided by historical cemeteries in Texas going “missing” from maps. Several cemeteries were known and marked on historical maps, but were later omitted from modern maps. This discrepancy is significant and leaves these “lost” cemeteries vulnerable. Minority cemeteries, particularly African and African American cemeteries, have a history of being damaged or destroyed during construction projects, only to be located on historical maps after the fact. Interdisciplinary research, including examinations of historical maps and an anthropological/archaeological understanding of mortuary customs, can help to preserve these unique and often underrepresented sites in American history."
2020,Forgotten Souls of the Dawn Settlement: A Multicomponent Geophysical Survey of Unmarked Graves at the British American Institute Cemetery,"The Dawn Settlement near Dresden in southwestern Ontario was a mid-19th-century community of escaped slaves, or “freedom seekers,” from the United States. In this study, a multicomponent geophysical survey (ground-penetrating radar, magnetic gradiometry, and electrical resistivity) was conducted on the British American Institute Cemetery, one of the two cemeteries directly associated with the settlement, to document the location of freedom-seeker graves whose markers had been damaged, knocked over, or removed during the 1960s due to the neglect and forgotten history of these burials. All the techniques provided useful information contributing to site interpretations, although GPR was found to be the most useful in identifying possible graves. We discuss the significance of incorporating archaeogeophysics techniques into heritage-management strategies and our responsibility to protect historical black cemeteries. Our survey also represents one of the first cemetery investigations related to the Underground Railroad in Canada."
2020,Landscapes and Ethnicity: An Historical Archaeology of Khami-Phase Sites in Southwestern Zimbabwe,"Although numerous dry-stone-walled Khami-phase sites are scattered throughout southwestern Zimbabwe, their finer archaeological and historical credentials remain largely elusive. Deliberations of how several dynastic and ethnolinguistic formations that are historically linked to the rise and spread of these sites can be archaeologically defined also remain multiple and fragmentary. Correspondingly, in attempts to trace Rozvi ethnicity, a sample of three ancient Khami-phase capitals––Danamombe, Naletale, and Zinjanja––was scrutinized in the light of an agency landscape framework. For the first time, radiocarbon dates from these sites are compared with each other in order to assess the validity of oral traditions and documentary sources describing the Rozvi past."
2020,The Place beyond the Fence: Slavery and Cultural Invention on a Delaware Tenant Farm,"Information about the lives and material culture of 18th- and early 19th-century enslaved black workers of West African birth or descent was recovered from Locus 1 of the Rumsey/Polk Tenant/Prehistoric site (7NCF112) in St. Georges Hundred, New Castle County, Delaware. This site contained the remains of multiple buildings interpreted as enslaved laborers’ quarters and associated cultural features, evidence of which is infrequently found in Delaware. Data from the site elucidate the current understanding of housing, diet, and cultural practices among the enslaved in the cultural borderland of the upper Mid-Atlantic region. Archaeology also reveals ways captives coped with the stresses of human trafficking, bondage, and subjugation, while simultaneously selectively modifying and reinventing cultural practices and customs."
2020,"Discovering San Antón de Carlos: The Sixteenth-Century Spanish Buildings and Fortifications of Mound Key, Capital of the Calusa","In 1566, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés arrived at the capital of the Calusa kingdom. During that same year Menéndez issued the order to construct Fort San Antón de Carlos, which was occupied until 1569. This fort was also the location of one of the first Jesuit missions (1567) in what is now the United States. We now can confirm what archaeologists and historians have long suspected: the location of the fort and the capital of the Calusa was Mound Key (8LL2), located in Estero Bay in southwestern Florida. In this article, we present the first archaeological evidence of structures and fortifications associated with the 16th-century Spanish fort and mission of San Antón de Carlos. We conducted this work, which includes both remote sensing and excavation, in an effort to better document the history of the Calusa capital up to and including the colonial period."
2020,Maintaining Traditions: Food and Identity among Early Immigrants to Upper Canada,"A critical examination of the relationships between food and identity is explored among early British and American Loyalist settlers in Upper Canada (southern Ontario) from the late 18th to the late 19th centuries. This research synthesizes zooarchaeological data from the region and interprets these alongside historical texts to address how meat was incorporated into early immigrant diets. Previous scholarship generally agreed that pork played a dominant role in Upper Canadian cuisine and that residents first settling in the area were particularly reliant on wild meat resources. Archaeological evidence suggests this was not the case. Results and discussions highlight the influence of British working-class traditions on Upper Canadian identities and the development of regional cuisines in southern Ontario. Parallels are drawn to anthropological and sociological studies of migrant foodways, encouraging archaeologists to consider the importance of maintaining food traditions when examining early immigrant assemblages."
2020,Status Creation and Maintenance among the Delaware Valley Elite: The Rise and Fall of the Field Family,"Archaeological excavations at the White Hill Mansion in Fieldsboro, Burlington County, New Jersey, revealed material evidence of identity construction and maintenance among the Delaware Valley’s rural elite during the late colonial and early Republic periods. This article focuses on the lives and experiences of the Field family at White Hill and, in particular, three of the property’s owners: Robert Field II, a successful merchant; his wife Mary Peale Field; and their son Robert Field III. The Fields were significant participants in the distinctive Quaker-influenced regional culture of the Delaware Valley, at times successfully and at times less so. Through agency theory, social constructs of gentility, documentary research, and both above- and below-ground archaeological evidence, the ways in which the Fields and their relatives employed material culture to create and maintain social, economic, and political identities from the 1750s to the 1810s are examined. The evidence reveals that individual family members used various methods and cultural behaviors to cultivate and sustain desired identities that occasionally had unintended and destructive consequences."
2020,"Race, Socioeconomic Status, and Land Ownership among Freed African American Farmers: The View from Ceramic Use at the Ransom and Sarah Williams Farmstead, Manchaca, Texas","There are few studies of post-emancipation-period African American agrarian landowners because their numbers were small in contrast to those African Americans who remained landless. Archaeologists’ emphasis on sharecroppers has overlooked the socioeconomic diversity within the African American community and minimized the importance of land ownership to the assertion of black freedom. Using the ceramics recovered from the Ransom and Sarah Williams farmstead, an historical African American site in central Texas, I show that land ownership enhanced the lives of freed African Americans by enabling them to become self-sufficient. This self-sufficiency was an important strategy that ensured their racial and economic autonomy within a precarious agricultural economy. However, their position was liminal because racism precluded them from using their landholdings in any way beyond the achievement of self-sufficiency. Therefore, land ownership was not economically emancipatory because African Americans were not able to build wealth."
2020,Historical Spatial-Data Infrastructures for Archaeology: Towards a Spatiotemporal Big-Data Approach to Studying the Postindustrial City,"While the use of geographic information systems (GIS) has become commonplace within the discipline of archaeology, the potential of a big-data approach to GIS is yet to be fully exploited within historical archaeology. Archaeologists inspired by developments in the social sciences and humanities have recently called for new ways of conceptualizing GIS as a process that is more theoretically satisfying and methodologically effective in its applications to archaeology. We respond to these calls by proposing a new approach for GIS in historical archaeology, an historical spatial-data infrastructure (HSDI). We outline the progression from historical GIS to the construction of an HSDI and present a series of case studies that demonstrate how using a spatiotemporal big-data-based approach expands the scale of archaeological inquiry to studying the postindustrial city."
2020,"Railroads, Recycling, Waste Disposal, and Remnant Refuse: Factors Affecting the Structure and Composition of Historical Archaeological Sites","The integrity of surface artifact assemblages on historical sites can be highly variable. Some sites are virtually barren, while others are awash in refuse. Why? This article explores the impact of rail access, wartime recycling, and differential access to consolidated refuse disposal on surface artifact assemblages found at historical sites in the American West. Sites that lacked rail access and did not participate in wartime recycling are most likely to be intact. In addition, assemblage effects due to differential access to consolidated refuse-disposal protocols are also examined. A suite of 10 historical sites, distributed across three states and dating between 1879 and 1960, is used to illustrate the variable effects of these three factors on surface refuse at historical sites in the West."
2020,The Discovery and Exploration of Tristán de Luna y Arellano’s 1559–1561 Settlement on Pensacola Bay,"Following the fortuitous 2015 discovery of a substantial assemblage of mid-16th-century Spanish ceramics in a residential neighborhood overlooking the Emanuel Point shipwrecks in Pensacola Bay, the University of West Florida Archaeology Institute worked with more than 120 landowners to conduct extensive archaeological testing across a broad area in order to determine the boundaries of and to explore the site. This article compares documentary and archaeological evidence to confirm the identification of the roughly 13–15 ha site as Tristán de Luna y Arellano’s 1559–1561 settlement, making it the largest mid-16th-century Spanish colonial site in the Southeast and the earliest multiyear European settlement in the entire United States."
2020,"Alignment of Old Land Surveys for Accurately Locating Archaeological Sites: The 1634 and 1646 Palisades in Middle Plantation, Colonial Virginia","The location of magnetic north has changed significantly during times relevant to historical archaeologists. To accurately locate sites of archaeological interest mentioned in old land surveys, which used magnetic compass bearings, alignment of those old surveys with true (geographic) north is required. This paper describes the method for doing this and provides an archaeological example of this approach for refining the locations of 17th-century wooden palisades in Williamsburg, Virginia."
2020,An Alter(ed)native Perspective on Historical Bioarchaeology,"This article analyzes intellectual and political work based in Howard University’s Cobb Research Laboratory relative to “new” and “emerging” ideas in bioarchaeology. Research conducted on remains from the Cobb Skeletal Collection and New York African Burial Ground is highlighted for this purpose. The analysis includes the period during which both collections were housed in the laboratory at the same time (1992–2003). I argue that the extent to which this work is considered relevant to scholarly developments in bioarchaeology is informed by the ways scholarship produced by people of color is regarded in general. It is often deemed “too specific” in focus to be generally relevant to disciplinary discussions. However, examination of the ways the discipline and researchers are socially embedded reveals this to be a product of racialized thinking that deems White scholarship universally applicable to intellectual inquiry—whereas the scholarship of non-Whites is not. Black-feminist theory and critiques of science are used to demonstrate that analyses of inequality centering on race are necessary for identifying and deconstructing the structural inequalities inherent in the discipline. Gina Athena Ulysse’s concept of an alter(ed)native perspective is used to illustrate how this literature provides language to name the complex subjectivities of researchers who both study and experience structural inequality."
2020,Caring Differently: Some Reflections,"Engaging love, care, and abandonment, but with an emphasis on care, I begin to question politics of care with human skeletal remains. This questioning strongly came to the fore while reflecting on preliminary observations of and interactions with skeletal remains that show evidence of postmortem interventions. These queries include, but are not limited to, the following: How does one not perpetuate colonialism when photographing and presenting bodies, eerily recalling colonial racial-documentation techniques? Are research objectives justifiable when these individuals cannot speak back? These kinds of caring and care-full concerns are important and disquieting. I ultimately ask to care differently about bioarchaeological practices, what they cite, and what they perpetuate. At stake is the importance of emergent politics of practice and tinkering with pointed questions."
2020,"Building Nation, Becoming Object: The Bio-Politics of the Samuel G. Morton Crania Collection","Here I use a biohistorical approach to examine the connection between 19th-century nation building in the United States and physicians’ collection of crania, notably “specimens” amassed by Dr. Samuel Morton. Globally disparate places are represented in the Morton Collection, though roughly 25% are Native Americans. Morton acquired these decedents as a result of colonial expansion and military conflicts that revised the national borders of the U.S. Events precipitating removal of natives from the Southeast, paying special attention to Florida, are demonstrative. During this process, “White” Americans’ retellings of interactions with “Indians” solidified into official history, while Morton’s craniometric studies reified racialized categories. This two-pronged “bio-political strategy” produced hegemonic notions of American citizenship that privileged Whiteness. In returning to the Morton Collection, however, I also identify traces—archival and skeletal—of past events and peoples that counterpoise official histories and, in so doing, point to the fragility of this nationalist project and racialization processes."
2020,Assembling Heads and Circulating Tales: The Doings and Undoings of Specimen 2032,"In April 1859, U.S. Army assistant surgeon Charles W. Brewer was dispatched to a remote mountain valley in the Utah Territory with orders to oversee the burial of 120 massacre victims. The scattered bones of overland immigrants who had been murdered by Mormon militiamen were gathered and interred in a series of mass graves. Though Brewer reported that his work was complete, he carried away from the site two skulls and “long tresses of dark and blonde hair of some of the tender victims” (Robinson 1884). One of the crania was recently identified in the collections of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, historically known as the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C. The analysis of “Specimen 2032” is presented here, along with the history of movements and encounters that brought it to this place. Rather than focus solely on the object’s authenticity or its linkages to the massacre site, we examine it within multiple assemblages—lively gatherings of materials, agents, and practices. In moving through these assemblages, the so-called specimen, we argue, is ontologically modified and transformed."
2020,Working in the City: An Historical Bioarchaeology of Activity in Urban New Spain,"The shifting sociopolitical environment of colonial Mexico City (1521–1821) resulted in a reorganization of labor obligations and opportunities for the city’s inhabitants. Bioarchaeological analysis of skeletal indicators of activity, in combination with historical documentary evidence, provide an avenue for understanding this change in daily-life activities. In particular, the intersection of different aspects of identity results in groups of individuals that shared similar kinds of biomechanical stress that may not have been identified using a traditional methodology of dividing data according to age and sex groups. Additionally, the kind of work a person performed may have had an impact on the social perception of identity in colonial life, which was based more on how a person lived than on physical appearance."
2020,"Restoring Identity to People and Place: Reanalysis of Human Skeletal Remains from a Cemetery at Catoctin Furnace, Maryland","Nearly four decades ago, a highway expansion project resulted in the excavation of 35 unmarked graves at Catoctin Furnace, an industrial ironworking village in western Maryland. Initial analysis identified the remains as Africans or African Americans associated with the late 18th- and early 19th-century operation of the ironworks. Renewed efforts to learn more about these poorly documented individuals and connect the site’s untold past to present generations through heritage tourism, prompted reanalysis of the skeletons. Updated assessments of demography and pathology, along with new analyses including heavy metals and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, elucidate the life histories of these early laborers and their involvement in furnace operations. Some data derived from recent testing differentiate the Catoctin Furnace individuals from their plantation-based contemporaries in the mid-Atlantic, suggesting regional differences in diet and possible occupational exposure to toxins."
2020,The Body Politic and the Citizen’s Mouth: Oral Health and Dental Care in Nineteenth-Century Manhattan,"As American democracy burgeoned in the 19th century, citizenship was expressed in the young nation in part through bodily-care regimes as well as consumption practices. The mouth, in particular, might therefore be considered a locus at which class, medical practices, and ideologies of citizenship and identity articulate. Historical bioarchaeology is uniquely situated to approach the broader social context of dental health in the past. Using multiple lines of evidence, including archaeological and archival sources, bioarchaeologists can investigate the ways discourses on health and the body, as well as urbanizing and industrializing forces, influenced both dental disease and dental care. This study investigates oral health in the skeletal remains from the Spring Street Presbyterian Church burial vaults (ca. 1820–1850) in New York City. Rates of carious lesions, abscesses, and antemortem tooth loss are contextualized through artifacts and historical documents. Archaeological evidence in the burial vaults for dental care includes prosthetic devices and fillings, while archival sources document preventative dental care, dietary choices, and engagement with discourses on the body and citizenship."
2020,“Against Shameless and Systematic Calumny”: Strategies of Domination and Resistance and Their Impact on the Bodies of the Poor in Nineteenth-Century Ireland,"Mid-Victorian British characterizations of Ireland and much of its population blamed race and “moral character” for the widespread poverty on the island. The Irish poor were portrayed as a “race apart” whose inherent failings were at least partly to blame for the mortality they suffered during the Great Famine of 1845–1852. Recent excavations at Kilkenny workhouse and Spike Island convict prison have produced skeletal assemblages from this critical period. These collections have enabled bioarchaeological analysis of parameters mentioned by the Victorians as indicative of the distinctiveness of the Irish poor: stature, interpersonal violence, and tobacco use. Bioarchaeological data indicate that the differences between Irish and British populations in stature and risk of violence were exaggerated. Such characterizations, we argue, were part of a strategy of “Othering” that served to legitimize colonial domination. This exertion of power did not go uncontested, as the pattern of tobacco use may be indicative of forms of passive resistance."
2020,Still Life: A Bioarchaeological Portrait of Perinatal Remains Buried at the Spring Street Presbyterian Church,"This article examines the perinatal remains from the Spring Street Presbyterian Church burial vaults of New York City. This early 19th-century collection contains the commingled remains of at least 13 perinates, and burial records indicate that 37 stillborn individuals, or individuals dying just after birth, were interred in the vaults between 1820 and 1850. By integrating historical records and the findings from the church, this article argues that the biological and social identities of perinates were made in relationship to their mothers, fathers, and the church institution itself. Such making draws on Ingold and Hallam’s (2016:5) metaphor that bodies are not just grown, but literally created, that the physical growth of an individual provides the material for the embodiment of personhood through socialization. This article explores how these biological and social identities were constructed for the perinates buried at the Spring Street Presbyterian Church."
2020,The Bush Hill Sugar Plantation: A West Indies Case Study in Developmental Capitalism,"The Caribbean frontier was dominated by agro-industrial sugar production. Localized adaptations of European designs for colonization in the Caribbean generated unique plantation landscapes. Before 1650, efforts throughout the region to create wealth from plantations did not achieve the scale of production that unfolded in the latter half of the 17th century as capitalism emerged. While tobacco farms briefly reaped rich rewards, for an adventurous and entrepreneurial few the prosperity of the colonies was ultimately sustained through a combination an increasing and seemingly unlimited demand for sugar, protectionist economic policies from the core state, and institutionalized slavery. A case study of agro-industrialism on the Bush Hill sugar estate on Nevis during the period of capitalism’s ascendancy provides insights on the incremental integration of capitalism into the plantation system."
2020,Pig Manure and Swizzle Sticks: Patterns of Urban Trash in Rural Settings,"Low-density scatters of historical period artifacts may be interpreted as byproducts of manure spreading. They consist of pieces of trash inadvertently mixed with food refuse that was fed to pigs. While most of these artifacts were not ingested, they became mired in the resulting manure that farmers spread on their fields as fertilizer. Whether or not a scatter of late historical artifacts represents manure spreading or some other kind of urban-trash disposal can be tested archaeologically, and that is the subject of this article. Archival data confirm that archaeological findings at the E. Z. Russell Farm site (18PR917) in Prince George’s County, Maryland, U.S.A., connect World War II–era commercial and institutional kitchens in Washington, D.C., with the feeding of pigs and subsequent use of their manure on nearby fields."
2020,"Native Lives in Colonial Times: Insights from the Skeletal Remains of Susquehannocks, A.D. 1575–1675","The experiences of Susquehannock Indians during the early period of European colonialism (1575–1675) included changes in subsistence, health, and violence, creating stressors that affected their lived experience. To begin to understand the embodied effects of these pressures, the skeletal remains of a number of Susquehannocks, recovered from sites in Pennsylvania and Maryland, were examined for evidence of oral health (dental caries, antemortem tooth loss, and dental abscess), skeletal trauma, growth disruption, and anemia. Our approach, informed by the “Osteological Paradox,” finds a trend of improvement in Susquehannock living conditions during that period that correlates well with the signing of a “Treaty of Friendship” with the colonial Maryland government in 1652. The treaty created an alliance and a southern “safe zone” for food procurement, and helped limit warfare to one front with the Iroquois to the north. This reprieve was short lived, as colonial relationships deteriorated by 1675, and Susquehannocks fled after the siege of their fort, which helped to trigger Bacon’s Rebellion in colonial Virginia."
2019,"Introduction: Rethinking the Archaeology of Capitalism: Coercion, Violence, and the Politics of Accumulation","Long an analytical staple of historical archaeology, capitalism in recent years has found itself under renewed scrutiny, due in part to the repercussions of the 2008 global economic crisis. Questions about the failings of “free-market” self-regulation and the proliferation of predatory practices and value-manipulation instruments fostered discussions about what, in fact, the “true” nature of capitalism was, and whether such practices, drawing on extra-economic power, violence, and various forms of coercion in the name of unequal accumulation, were aberrational or foundational. A space emerges within these discussions for a critical rethinking of capitalism through the emerging contributions of feminist, new materialist, actor-network, and (post-)Marxist perspectives that emphasize the diverse mechanisms and practices generative of the effects attributed variously to an abstract, monolithic, epoch-defining capitalist system. The approaches articulated in this thematic collection push for a move away from limiting and inconsistent definitions of capitalism, and toward a more supple suite of analytical threads for the cross-context analysis of diverse assemblages with diverse histories of emergence that generate parallel capitalist effects. In turn, the contributors to this collection illustrate the broader relevance of the contributions of historical archaeologies of capitalism to other archaeological contexts and subdisciplines by providing common ground for the comparative analysis of contexts generative of similar human/nonhuman experiences and effects that have remained categorically segregated in their analyses."
2019,Capitalism and the Shift to Sugar and Slavery in Mid-Seventeenth-Century Barbados,"The origins of capitalism in the British West Indies began as part of the revolutionary shift to sugar and slavery in Barbados in the second quarter of the 17th-century. This study examines the origins of capitalism in Barbados through the exploration of the historical record and archaeological findings from Trents Plantation and other early colonial estates in Barbados. The expansion of agro-industrial sugar production into the English colony of Barbados set in motion a dramatic shift in social and economic structures. Social and economic change resulted from the intersection of access to investor capital, dramatic profits rapidly amassed through the production of a commoditized cash crop, sugar, and a related shift in the labor force to a reliance on large numbers of enslaved laborers from Africa. The change took place rapidly during a period of political turmoil in England that resulted in laissez-faire governance and a void in administrative oversight in the West Indies. The social and economic changes seen in the archaeological record at Trents, and actuated across Barbados, had a dramatic impact on the broader Atlantic World, inclusive of the Americas, Europe, Africa, and their trading partners across the globe."
2019,Violence and Dispossession at the Intersection of Colonialism and Capitalist Accumulation,"Drawing inspiration from the writings of Rosa Luxemburg, this article examines the role of consumer behavior in the growth of capitalism, as well as the roles of violence and accumulation by dispossession at the intersection of colonialism and capitalist accumulation. In her critique of Marx, Luxemburg asked what had created the demand for the goods that fueled capitalist expansion. She also called for more studies of the “real-life” experiences of those who were actors in capitalist economies. This article examines case studies from 12th- to 16th-century Europe and Britain for evidence of consumerism driving economic expansion, and takes a detailed look at the manner in which colonial legal systems contributed to the violence and dispossession experienced by the Nipmuc of Massachusetts and Connecticut. These two forces—consumer behavior and accumulation through dispossession––are presented as critical elements of an emerging political economy that was linked to the growth of capitalism."
2019,"Ruins, Resources, and Archaeology: Valuing People and Spaces in Baltimore","The capitalist process seeks to maximize the accumulation of capital by creating, maintaining, and reinventing divisions and distance. The result is the devaluing of people to a state whereby they are expendable and the violence they experience can be justified, perpetuated, and ignored. Space is a crucial component of this process, allowing for the destruction and creation of new configurations of capital circulation that foster a landscape of depreciation and exploitation. The landscapes of Baltimore throughout time show the contrast between affluence and poverty and the degree to which the capitalist process shapes lives and space in and around the city and devalues them. Drawing from Baltimore, this article argues that archaeology can play a role in detailing the history of capitalism in space and can work towards countering its effects."
2019,Cacao and Violence: Consequences of Money in Colonial Guatemala,"This article investigates the meeting of two monetized economies and how producing a “commodity money” nurtured forms of violence. This case presents an opportunity to rethink why economies monetize and how that relation fits into coercive, violent foundations of an emerging capitalist system. Money is important for understanding early capitalism, as Marx suggested that money is the first form of the appearance of capital. Money masks the social nature of labor, a fiction that not only creates conditions for capitalism, but is violent by wrenching the self from social bonds. Archaeological examples illustrate relationships of money with corporeal and social violence in the Izalcos region of colonial Guatemala, part of today’s western El Salvador. The early colonial market relied on exploiting inequalities as well as the predictability of native production. A stable currency based on cacao as small coin buffered the awkwardness and unpredictability of a volatile economy."
2019,Deeper Histories of Dispossession: The Genealogy of “Proletarian” Relations in Iceland,"“Proletarian” relations are generally understood in terms of capitalist dispossession. However, a deeper historical approach to class relations in Iceland reveals the fundamental role of monopolization and labor insecurity across capitalist and pre-capitalist political economies. During the first settlement of Iceland in the late 9th century A.D., land was freely available to colonists, but by the late 17th century, over 95% of all farming properties were owned by landlords. Landlords and tenants frequently negotiated new leases, effectively creating a dispossessed, insecure, and mobile class of tenant farmers. Using the millennium-long history and archaeology of farmsteads in Skagafjörður, northern Iceland, we then outline (1) how it is that these “proletarian” relations came about in the first place, (2) how they were maintained, and, finally, (3) how Iceland’s “transition to capitalism” in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was less the creation of a uniquely proletarian class than a migration of long-dispossessed labor under new capital regimes."
2019,Western Activism and the Veiling of Primitive Accumulation in the East African Ivory Trade,"This article explores themes of morality and capitalist exploitation within the context of the East African ivory trade. Through an interdisciplinary lens that incorporates object-based, archival analysis and critical heritage studies, this article traces how morality-tinged, Western-driven narratives concerning the ivory trade mobilize asymmetrical relationships of capitalist exchange in both the past and present. In the late 19th century, the abolitionist movement conflated the East African ivory and slave trades by narrating the forced coercion of Africans made to carry ivory tusks in the interior, only to be sold into slavery upon reaching the coast. This discursively erased histories of active African engagement with mercantile capitalism as well as emerging labor culture among professional porters of the caravan trade. The vilification of “Arab” slave traders through stories of extreme cruelty within the ivory trade was used to justify formal British colonialism in the region, which led to more expansive capitalist integration and extraction. In a circuitous fashion, contemporary Western conservation activists blame African corruption, Islamic extremism, and Asian consumption for rampant elephant and rhino poaching across East Africa, making way for neoliberal appropriation of East African heritage under the guise of moral interventionism. In both cases, moral (and Orientalist) arguments advocating liberation, heritage preservation, and economic development veil processes by which unequal exchange is facilitated and maintained."
2019,Framings of Capitalism and the Archaeology of Sugar in the Islamic Mediterranean,"Seeking to widen the constellation of pasts in studies of capitalism, this article contributes to interventions into the dominant narratives and frameworks in the history of capitalism. It discusses Western historiography and historicism in relation to the role that Islamic cultural geographies and sugar, as an iconic commodity, have played in the history of European capitalism and colonialism. This alternative rendition of sugar brings together significant archaeological and historical sources of sugar production in Egypt and Syria-Palestine during the medieval and Ottoman periods. Islamic sugar production and markets are discussed in relation to Western framings of historical capitalism, global commodities, unequal exchange, and capital accumulation. Questioning modernity’s framing of history and capitalism, this article offers a view of more diverse and changing configurations of interaction, and suggests a shift in analytical emphasis to market exchange in the past in order to make comparisons between commercial and market-oriented societies."
2019,"Peanuts, Pangool, and Places: Constellations of Colonial Capitalism in Rural Senegal","Histories of cash-crop agriculture in Senegal’s peanut basin have foregrounded the sway of market forces—an economic story of supply and demand staging metropolitan industrial needs, commercial entrepreneurialism, and profitable returns with both planned and unplanned developments. The political connivance between commercial crops and French rule is also well documented. The relentless expansion of peanut cultivation in Senegal’s hinterland was promoted by colonial policies and collusions between the French administration and Muslim brotherhoods. African farmers were not idle bystanders to these transformations, as peasant social strategies were centrally implicated in the (re)construction of colonial countrysides. While accounts illuminate the broad structural forces and human institutions involved in the commodification of African rural worlds, they frequently overlook the contributions of a host of other historical actors: the unsung, yet influential, nonhuman agencies that were integral components of farming ecologies, shaped people’s affective belonging to their landscapes, and actively mediated histories of capitalist transformations. In this article I attend specifically to the overlapping roles and material effects of three categories of “inanimate actors” in the adoption of cash cropping in the Senegalese province of Siin: peanuts, pangool (ancestral spirits), and places. Drawing on Adorno’s (1973) concept of “constellation” and Deleuze and Guattari’s (1987) idea of “assemblage,” I examine how the tangible properties of crops, spiritual beings, and rural geography (and the social practices it nurtured) combined to assist and disrupt the operations of capital and government. Peanuts, pangool, and places drew humans and nonhumans into material constellations that cut across the plain of political economic analysis and offset totalizing visions of global capitalism; they reveal alternative tales of power, labor, and intimacy, “understories” that speak to the contingent, hybrid, and unfinished histories of colonial modernity in Africa."
2019,“The Destructive Character”: The Recapitalization of a Shanty Town into a Suburb (after a Brief Emancipation),"In Pardeesville, Pennsylvania, migrant laborers constructed a shantytown at the periphery of a coal-company town in the late 19th century. For the first half of its existence it represented an exceptional space excluded from paternalist care, but also exempt from surveillance and infrastructural development. It housed a flexible labor force for the mechanized industry increasingly central to its operations. The collapse of the anthracite industry in the 1940s brought the withdrawal of company ownership and a brief period of employee ownership. Following the town’s emancipation from capitalist control, residents developed forms of communal self-organization adapted from the survival strategies of an earlier era. By the 1960s, however, regional government pursued efforts to recapitalize the postindustrial landscape, guided by national ideologies of redevelopment and renewal. This governmentalizing process radically altered the material landscape, bringing with it neoliberal economics and its corresponding subjectivities."
2019,Assemblages of Production: Capitalist Colonial Labor Regimes and other Productive Practices in Highland Guatemala,"The consequences of Spanish colonial/capitalist intrusions in highland Guatemala are an emerging focus of archaeological investigation. While providing insight into the entanglements between colonialism and capitalism and their effects on Maya communities, it is critical not to fixate only on extractive and exploitative labor regimes to the exclusion of other patterns of practice and production central to the experience of people in the past. In our analyses, a singular focus on capitalist colonialism reifies the suffocating ubiquity of abstract processes, foreclosing the possibility of other ways of being in the world that were not capitalist, colonial, or formed in relation or opposition to them. Instead, a holistic approach to the assemblage of production practices in capitalist colonial contexts allows for analyses of “capitalist” practices that exist side side-by-side and/or articulated with other practices—traditional and innovative—outside the unproductive two-step of either resistance to or engagement with capitalism or colonialism. In this article we use archival and archaeological research on colonial Maya sites in the piedmont and highland regions of Guatemala to piece together the spectrum of economic and productive practices carried out by colonial Maya communities: some coerced, some opportunistic of the emerging colonial economic landscape, and others having little to do with the intrusions of capitalist/colonial practices and effects."
2019,How Can There Be No History?,"Many African American communities in Maryland have been free since before emancipation. Members of these communities have been disfranchised through silence, denial, condemnation of properties, and through the use of eminent domain. The Hill Community of Easton, Maryland, was founded shortly after the American Revolution and remains a vital environment into the present. The town of Easton and Talbot County produced Frederick Douglass, aided Harriet Tubman who came from nearby Dorchester County, and also produced many White families who supported the Confederate South and the continuation of slavery. This article uses five summers of archaeological work on the Hill performed in concert with the descendant communities to knit together political needs, historical documentation compiled by local scholars, oral presentations, and members of the University of Maryland’s Archaeology in Annapolis to outline a history and alternative analysis for the remnants of slavery and racism often found on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. We use Slovaj Žižek to find an answer to the question in our title: How can there be no history?"
2019,"Agents of Coloniality: Capitalism, the Market, and My Crisis with Archaeology","Recent experiences within the discipline and my fieldwork in the town of Portobelo, Panama, have left me questioning the epistemic genealogy of archaeology and the complicity between archaeological and capitalist ontologies. Observing the specter of dispossession that hangs over Portobelo as a result of Eurocentric archaeological discourses and heritage-management practices of conservation has directed me to analyze archaeological knowledge production within the coloniality of power. I contemplate how archaeology is implicated in the violence that allows capitalism to persist by examining processes of dispossession through an exploration of the relationship among archaeology, discourses of market development, and the logics of coloniality/modernity that inform them."
2019,Storm in a Teacup: The Life of a Nineteenth-Century New Zealand Settler Told through Her Tea Ware,"Tea ware has been the focus of numerous North American and Australian historical archaeology studies of female consumer behavior in colonial contexts. This article uses data from a 19th-century urban site in Whanganui, New Zealand, to examine how these previously explored experiences of self-expression and social pressure compare to those of a woman from another part of the colonial world. To do this, the ways in which three aspects of Mary Byrne’s tea-ware assemblage changed over time were examined and considered alongside events that occurred during her 40-year occupation of the site. The results highlight the varied and complex ways in which a first-generation settler in New Zealand used material culture to negotiate a place in her new community."
2019,"Taming Chaos: Labor, Economy, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Mexico","During the 19th century, Mexico was embroiled in social and economic turmoil. Faced with the same problems shared by many young nations, Mexico’s elite needed to find a way to rein in the chaos and create a unified, stable, and modern citizenry. Drawing on archival and archaeological data, this article explores the economic and social instability faced by rural landowners in central Mexico’s Valley of Atlixco and discusses a strategic solution to these problems. By examining changes in the architectural layout of the Hacienda San Miguel Acocotla, I demonstrate that rural landowners attempted to transform the very identities of their workers by implementing programs of modernization that not only affected their work habits, but also their home lives."
2019,"The Woman from Leuk (Switzerland)—Discovery, Conservation, and Interdisciplinary Investigations of a Seventeenth-Century Mummy","During the excavation of St. Stephan’s Church in Leuk (Switzerland) in the 1980s, a well-preserved mummy with clothing and shoes was found in a wooden coffin. Subsequently, the mummy underwent restoration, but the observations have never been published. Therefore, an interdisciplinary investigation was recently organized that included a thorough archaeological and anthropological documentation in collaboration with specialists in costume history and leatherworking. The aim was to gather evidence for the dating and preservation mechanism, as well as to determine the biological profile of the individual. The investigation was accompanied by a noninvasive examination with a mobile x-ray device, which enabled identification of sex, age, body height, and pathologies. The clothing (cape, blouse, skirt, drawers) and the shoes were subjected to a detailed stylistic and technological examination. The individual is female, aged 45–60 years, with foot deformities that might be related to constricting footwear. Stylistic details of the shoes indicate that the burial dates from the first half of the 17th century, more precisely to the 1630s. Despite her simple clothing, the burial location attests to her respected position in society."
2019,Archaeology in the Palm of Your Hand: Using Photogrammetry and 3-D Printing to Record and Recreate Excavations at Fairfield Plantation,"The Fairfield Foundation is using new technology to record and recreate archaeology at Fairfield Plantation. Using drone-based photogrammetry, Autodesk 3-D modeling software, and a MakerBot 3-D printer, the organization is developing three-dimensional models of every stratigraphic layer excavated, then printing replicas of each layer that connect seamlessly. This interactive model of the site is ideal for teaching students and the public about archaeology while engaging them in the history and architecture of Fairfield Plantation. At the same time, it creates the most detailed archive of archaeological data yet undertaken at this site, providing the foundations for future virtual and augmented reality applications and preserving a vital record of the archaeology. Methods developed for this project can be applied at any site, enhancing outreach and site documentation efforts around the world, especially when initiated at the onset of a project."
2019,Excavating the “Garden of the North”: Five Centuries of Material and Social Change in Western Massachusetts: An Introduction,"The recent history of western Massachusetts was shaped by a set of processes familiar in post-Columbian North America, including colonization, revolutionary repositioning in the Atlantic and world system, industrialization and deindustrialization, struggles for racial emancipation and gender and sexual equality, and the emergence of cultural reproduction to supplement, and increasingly to replace, the loss of industrial work. The particular political, economic, social, ideological, and ecological contexts of western Massachusetts are presented to provide background for the finer-grained studies in the articles that follow."
2019,"Gendered Landscapes: Women, Materiality, and Historical Memory in Deerfield, Massachusetts","Many historical elements visible on landscapes today, such as structures, vegetation, waterways, and landforms, sometimes give the impression of having survived substantially unchanged since their beginnings centuries ago. Moreover, this aura of “timelessness” is often deliberately encouraged by various means, for multiple and complex reasons. The movement for historic preservation (of aged buildings and, more recently, their surroundings), that grew in the United States from around the mid-19th century, has been a participant. Manifestations of this important historical trend are explored here through the lens of gender by looking at the materiality of cultural change on the landscape of the village and the homelot of the Frary House/Barnard Tavern in Deerfield, Massachusetts, along with several human agents."
2019,Entangled Things and Deposits in Early Colonial Native New England,"We consider the entanglement of objects and deposits at an early colonial-period Native American site in New England’s middle Connecticut River valley. We examine the acquisition, circulation, and deposition of archaeological materials and consider the obligations, reciprocities, and networks maintained and reworked by Pocumtuck people and their native and nonnative neighbors. The archaeological evidence indicates increasingly circumscribed networks as stone, copper, clay, shell, and glass created debts, obligations, and duties between individuals and communities. The Pocumtuck, along with their kin and allies, were entangled in colonialism as active co-producers of social transformation."
2019,Glass Cabinets and Little Black Boxes: The Collections of H. H. Wilder and the Curious Case of His Human-Hair Samples,"Harris Hawthorne Wilder, a professor of zoology at Smith College, was trained in anatomy and physical anthropology in Germany at the end of the 19th century. He taught at Smith College, a private liberal-arts college for women, from 1892 to 1927. Not unusual for the times, his interests in archaeology and anthropology were very broad. He excavated sites in what can be considered, at best, dubious ethical circumstances and created a wide-ranging collection of artifacts, human remains, and anatomical specimens. One of the more curious collections was of human-hair samples, which included “specimens” from students at Smith College, his own family members, and a small subcategory he referred to as “ethnics.” We chart his proclivity for collecting many items of an anatomical, archaeological, or anthropological nature, and focus on his human-hair samples to contextualize the nature of these collections in terms of late 19th- and early 20th-century views on race, ethnicity, and gender in anthropology. We take the position that to understand this collection more fully it is essential to know the life and times of its collector, including his role in the academic history of the Connecticut Valley, and we suggest that Wilder himself was conflicted as to its meaning and purpose."
2019,"The Materiality of Fishing, Property, and Labor in Western Massachusetts","This article explores the complexities of property and competing regimes of value in the colonial and Federal periods. The end of the 18th century saw a growing privatization of previously common resources as part of the emergence of a broadly, if unevenly, constituted capitalist mode of production in western Massachusetts. Excavations at the Frary House/Barnard Tavern in rural Deerfield, Massachusetts, provide a seemingly mundane index of this broad social change in the differential presence of fish scales in trash pits at the site. Anadromous fish have been a means of subsistence for indigenous communities who lived along the Connecticut River valley for thousands of years, but following English colonization and conquest, they became caught up in broader anxieties and struggles over the nature of work, property, and social and material value. This article documents some of these struggles in the region, as a reminder that consumption and subsistence are never isolated from broader social and structural processes."
2019,"Haven to the East, Haven to the North: Great Barrington and Pittsfield, Massachusetts","In the first decades of the 18th century, people of African descent accompanied Dutch and British settlers into the Berkshires. In 1783, Massachusetts abolished slavery by judicial decree. In the first federal census in 1790, Massachusetts and Vermont were the only states in the Union that recorded no captive Africans, at least officially. Therefore, these states were seen as havens for those fleeing captivity in slaveholding states. Although Whites transferred their “common sense” understanding of captive Africans to the free population, African Americans created “homeplaces,” as two archaeological assemblages in Massachusetts reveal. The boyhood home of W. E. B. Du Bois in Great Barrington and the Reverend Samuel Harrison Homestead in Pittsfield demonstrate how families were able to create domestic harbors within racialized space. Additionally, issues of identity formation, in a nation that was creating an American identity that was not inclusive of all, are addressed."
2019,"Contexts of Resistance in African American Western Massachusetts: A View from the W. E. B. Du Bois Homesite in Great Barrington, Massachusetts","The childhood home of W. E. B. Du Bois in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, has been the focus of archaeological research since the 1980s. Reports of this work have mainly focused on the materials recovered from the site, the people who created it, and its implications for African American archaeology. In this article we report on the regional contexts for the site and its residents, and the role of African American “homeplaces” within this larger context, issues that will guide future work at the W. E. B. Du Bois Homesite."
2019,"Domestic Ideals and Lived Realities: Gendered Social Relations at the Moors House, Deerfield, Massachusetts, 1848–1882","Two families—the Moors and the Balls—occupied a 19th-century house on the main street of Deerfield, Massachusetts. Archaeological assemblages associated with each of the households showed disconnects between gender ideals (notably the cult of domesticity for which the architectural style of the house itself is iconic) and the realities of poverty, raising children, and life cycle. In this article, I explore how variations in the materiality and spatiality of gender ideologies were more than simply deviations from middle-class cultural norms. Rather, they represented active negotiation of dominant ideals and the construction of alternate meaningful gender relations and forms of domesticity."
2019,The Sensory Landscape of the Mid-Nineteenth-Century Connecticut River Valley,"Landscapes have long been a focus of archaeological study, with particular attention paid to how they serve to shape the relationship between structures and features across space. More recently, archaeologists have begun to consider the experiential dimension of the landscape and how the senses serve to mediate how people make sense of space and place. Through careful analysis of the multisensory landscape of the mid-19th-century Connecticut River valley and the sensory world of the blind and Black abolitionist, journalist, and doctor David Ruggles, the process whereby people come to be connected to historical processes materially and sensually is revealed. This analysis illustrates how abolition, industrialization, and racialization were experienced through the senses and how they impacted Ruggles’s experience of the landscape."
2019,"“All My Little Might of Money”: Signaling, Structure, and Mobility among the Middling in Nineteenth-Century Virginia and Kentucky","Archaeological testing of a site occupied by farm manager Edmund Bacon and his family (ca. 1806–1822) at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello in Virginia raised questions about how costly signals operated and other roles that materiality played in this social milieu. Free and White, but neither wealthy nor well educated, Bacon’s positionality both limited and facilitated his socioeconomic mobility. He gathered his “little might of money” to become a prominent Kentucky landowner. Bacon’s experiences and those of his contemporaries, elite and enslaved, illustrate the weight of durable structural inequalities in constituting such personal qualities as wealth, knowledge, and social connection."
2019,Memorialization and Heritagization: Investigating the Site of the Last Execution by Hanging in Finland,"This article focuses on the processes of memorialization and heritagization through a case study from Oulu, Finland, where a cast-iron rail encircling a pine tree constitutes a memorial marking the site of the country’s last official execution by hanging in 1916. The memorial and its immediate surroundings are examined here through historical documents and maps, tree-ring data, interviews, and the results of small-scale archaeological excavations. The evidence indicates various modes of interaction—crosses carved on the memorial tree, a magical cache, finds pertaining mainly to the consumption of intoxicating substances—exposing a lesser-known and more intimate side of the site biography than is evident from written records. Finally, both individual and national practices of remembering and forgetting related to the memorial highlight the way memorialization transformed the death of an ordinary man into a nationalistic symbol to be used and exploited in various quarters during the past century."
2019,Identifying and Analyzing Agricultural Landscapes Using Metal-Detector Survey and Nail-Batch Analysis,"Ephemeral agricultural outbuildings and landscape elements that were integral to the management and production of Virginia plantations, such as barns, sheds, pens, and fence lines, are often difficult to locate and analyze using traditional archaeological survey and excavation techniques. The archaeological signatures of these types of sites are usually characterized by a relatively light scatter of nails, which can be efficiently found and preliminarily interpreted using a combination of metal-detector survey and nail-batch analysis. Drawing upon the historic Montpelier plantation as a case study, this study shows how these survey-level data can help archaeologists begin to interpret how outbuildings were located, constructed, deconstructed, and used in the 18th and 19th centuries. Using these easily replicated methodologies, archaeological data relating to ephemeral rural landscapes from a variety of regions and time periods can be recovered and examined, allowing for more holistic understandings of spaces and places in the past."
2019,"Identifying Landscape Modification using Open Data and Tools: The Charcoal Hearths of the Blue Mountain, Pennsylvania","In this technical brief I demonstrate two methodological points broadly relevant to historical archaeologists. While light detection and ranging (LiDAR), also known as airborne laser scanning (ALS), has been widely used to identify prehistoric archaeological sites, its use in historical archaeology could be expanded. LiDAR data are particularly valuable because they are frequently open access. By coupling open LiDAR data with open source software one can quickly, easily, and inexpensively identify historical landscape modification. I present an illustrative example, the identification of charcoal hearths in Pennsylvania, along with tools and techniques used to carry out the research. This method has allowed us to identify 758 charcoal hearths within a 74 km2 research area along the Blue Mountain of northeastern Pennsylvania."
2019,The Archaeology of Machinic Consumerism: The Logistics of the Factory Floor in Everyday Life,"In the period after the First World War a new kind of Machine Age mass consumerism was developed as a parsimonious solution to twin crises confronting the country, one political and the other economic. This machinic consumerism was the key to the integration and intensification of a heterogeneous network composed of new commodity forms, infrastructure, logistics, financial and governmental structures, landscapes, subjectivities, and machinic processes. A theoretical framework developed out of Marx’s reflections on the use of machines on the factory floor is effective in illuminating the many nodes of this assemblage. Recognizing the linkages within a machinic network requires transcending traditional dualisms between micro- and macro-processes, histories and presents, humans and machines, and material and ideological processes. An archaeological assemblage excavated from a coal-company town shanty enclave in Pennsylvania provides examples of how artifact morphologies reflect the infrastructure, landscapes, aesthetics, advertising strategies, and media effects of these developments."
2019,Anxiety in the Consumer Shell,"This commentary examines Michael Roller’s metaphor of the machine to describe the social conditioning associated with 20th-century mass consumption. Roller’s machinic mass consumerism evokes familiar anxieties in its illumination of the ways consumer materiality shapes human experience. The hazard is that machinic mass consumerism risks understating the everyday creativity, retreat, silence, and imagination that negotiate and upset the machinery of mass consumer culture."
2019,The Ghost in the Machine: A Response to Roller,"In this commentary, I reflect on the productive relations of the Simone family, the occupants of the site that Roller uses for his case study, to suggest that arguments for consumption need to be dialectically integrated with understandings of production relations. Adding production to the machinic recognizes that the very concept of the machine relates to transformations in work and labor in capitalist production, as machines increasingly replace human labor. From the perspective of productive relations, different questions emerge that should resonate with everyone in our contemporary moment: What happens when capital does not need our labor? What happens when capital does not need us to consume?"
2019,"Disrupted Identities and Frontier Forts: Enlisted Men and Officers at Fort Lane, Oregon Territory, 1853–1856","Frontiers are contingent and dynamic arenas for the negotiation, entrenchment, and innovation of identity, and the imposing materiality of frontier fortifications and their prominence in colonial topographies make them ideal laboratories in which to examine this dynamic. This article presents the results of large-scale excavations in 2011 and 2012 at the officers’ quarters and enlisted men's barracks at Fort Lane, a U.S. Army outpost used during the Rogue River Wars in southern Oregon between 1853 and 1856. We consider how, within this arena, the identities of social class, Confederate or Union, and East Coaster or frontiersman, were crafted in this pre–Civil War frontier setting at the dawn of the modern era."
2019,"Cultural Identity and Materiality at French Fort St. Joseph (20BE23), Niles, Michigan","Fort St. Joseph was one of many French colonial outposts established throughout the St. Lawrence River valley and the western Great Lakes region in the late 17th to 18th centuries to cultivate alliances with native peoples. The result was an exchange, amalgamation, and reinterpretation of material goods that testify to the close relationships the French maintained with various Native American groups. Yet, closer examination suggests that both the French and natives employed material goods in distinctive ways to ensure survival and promote their interests in the colonial encounter; borrowing was merely an expedient strategy. This interpretation shifts attention away from the amicable relations, altruistic behaviors, and hybridization that researchers previously posited toward an understanding grounded in more pragmatic forms of materiality that agents practice to ensure the persistence of cultural identities under colonialism."
2019,"Flat Ontologies, Cosmopolitanism, and Space at Carolina Forts","English forts in the Carolina Colony embodied the ongoing struggle between the ambitions of imperial impositions and the aspirations of frontier autonomy. This tension is acutely reflected in the spatial organization of forts. Whereas colonial authorities sought to separate Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans through the formal segregation of the built environment, life on the frontier encouraged a fluidity in space and identity. The theoretical construct of flat ontologies can be used to explore how frontier forts were a catalyst for complex and emergent spatial relations that subverted hierarchical space. Archaeological data from early 18th-century forts on the Carolina frontier exemplify the connective processes of flat ontologies that blurred space and identity."
2019,Transfer-Printed Gastroliths: Fowl-Ingested Artifacts and Identity at Fort Vancouver’s Village,"Transfer-printed ceramics and other objects ingested by fowl provide unique data on the household production associated with a fur-trade center in the Pacific Northwest. Gastroliths are an indicator of the use of avifauna at archaeological sites, specifically those of the order Galliformes. The presence of ceramic and glass gastroliths at house sites within Fort Vancouver’s village provides evidence for the keeping and consumption of domestic fowl, including chickens and turkeys. The presence and concentration of these artifacts, combined with documentary and other evidence, provide clues about household economies in a culturally diverse colonial setting. While ethnic backgrounds of the villagers included native Hawai‘ian, American Indian, French Canadian, English, and American, archaeological and archival evidence points to shared practices emerging within Fort Vancouver Village."
2019,"Colonial Identities of United States Army Commissioned Officers: The Negotiation of Class and Rank at Fort Yamhill and Fort Hoskins, Oregon, 1856–1866","During the 19th century the American West played host to the colonial expansion of the United States. This period saw an attempt by the federal government to balance the westward expansion of White settlement spurred, in part, by ideas of Manifest Destiny, with what was then believed to be a humane solution to the “Indian problem.” What resulted from these attempts was the reservation system, where native peoples were relocated to reservations to be kept separate from White settlement and guarded by a system of U.S. Army forts. These forts became liminal environments in which the army operated both as the oppressors and protectors of indigenous peoples and lifeways, and also as stages for the display and transmission of European American ideas of social class and personal identity. Commissioned officers at these posts played an important role as actors in the drama of colonial westward expansion, holding identities as both frontiersmen and as bastions of 19th-century American sociocultural norms of social inequality and their expression through material culture. This article examines the material expressions of class represented by artifact assemblages recovered from six commissioned officers’ houses at Fort Yamhill and Fort Hoskins. The artifact assemblages from these posts suggest that these army officers not only brought the sociocultural norms of materialism and conspicuous consumption with them to the frontiers, but that they were also highly competitive individuals who were interested in displaying and affirming their identities as colonizers and as members of the sociocultural elite."
2019,"At Freedom’s Borderland: The Black Regulars and Masculinity at Fort Davis, Texas","Archaeologies of military life have made little contribution to the study of Black regulars on the frontier. In part, this is the result of disciplinary boundaries separating scholars who study military history from those who study the African diaspora. Other problems include the nature of military movements and the nature of military record keeping. In this article, ceramic materials from an 1870s deposit associated with Black enlisted men at Fort Davis, Texas, are discussed to demonstrate how material evidence provides insights into the ambitions, experiences, and actions of soldiers, in their status as freedmen and citizens, as they navigated the colonial structure of a western fort."
2019,"Frontier Intermediaries: Army Laundresses at Fort Davis, Texas","As contested spaces, frontiers are the ideal location in which to study identity, as inhabitants of these landscapes constantly experience and actively negotiate among the multiple lived realities that are shaped by conflicting ideologies. I propose the use of third-space and borderlands theory as frameworks for understanding the fluidity of experiences in the American frontier during the 19th century. Through a look at a community of laundresses in Fort Davis, Texas, I show how life on the edge—or perhaps in the middle—of geographic and social frontiers allowed inhabitants of these contested spaces to construct and redefine new personhoods. Moreover, I assert that women’s participation in food provisioning and preparation allowed them to act as cultural brokers across various scales of community interaction."
2019,"Forts on Burial Mounds: Interlocked Landscapes of Mourning and Colonialism at the Dakota-Settler Frontier, 1860–1876","During the 19th century, the U.S. government took ownership of Dakota homelands in Minnesota and the Dakota Territory, leading to increasingly violent conflicts and decades of war. Military and militia forts were built at the physical boundaries of contested space to push “hostiles” west and to protect European American settlers. Fort Wadsworth, constructed in South Dakota during the 1864 Dakota Campaign, and Fort Juelson, built in 1876 by Norwegian immigrants during an “Indian scare” in Minnesota, were both knowingly constructed on top of burial mounds, appropriating and reshaping sacred Native American landscapes into protective enclosures for the dominating, yet fearful, colonizers. Aerial laser scanning, geophysical survey, and historical research explore the archaeological expression and significance of these interlocked landscapes at geographic and cognitive frontiers."
2019,The Case for Radiocarbon Dating and Bayesian Analysis in Historical Archaeology,"Few historical archaeologists working on sites that postdate A.D. 1500 employ radiocarbon dating throughout the course of their research. We argue that historical archaeologists underutilize radiocarbon dating, and present the case for its use and Bayesian modeling of the dates. We illustrate these methods with a simulated hypothetical example and an archaeological example from the mission period in the American Southeast. Our work shows that through the careful consideration of sample selection and the integration of prior knowledge regarding the archaeological record, one can dramatically increase the precision of radiocarbon dating on samples from historical sites, which can play an important role in secondary research question formulation and sampling across historical sites."
2019,Defining Karst Defenses: Construction and Features,"During World War II, in the Pacific theater, the Japanese military and civilians used “karst defenses”—caves and tunnels—for various purposes. Despite their widespread distribution across the Pacific, karst defenses have received little historical and archaeological attention. As a result, archaeologists record and describe these sites inconsistently. A project in Saipan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, sought to record karst defenses in order to understand the defensive strategies and tactics people employed at them during World War II. This article discusses the karst defenses constructed and used by the Japanese military and offers a basis for recording them. The information presented will be of value to both archaeologists and historians studying World War II defensive strategies in the Pacific."
2018,Walking in Their Shoes: A Late Victorian Shoe Assemblage from the New Mississippi River Bridge Project in East St. Louis,"A significant number of shoes and shoe parts were recovered during the Illinois State Archaeological Survey’s excavations in East St. Louis for the Illinois Department of Transportation as part of the New Mississippi River Bridge Project (NMRB). The breadth and range of shoe styles in the NMRB collection are indicative of identity, gender, and occupation, as well as local consumption patterns. These topics are illuminated by examining construction methods (soles), style (uppers), and shoe size. This article explores the different types of styles and constructions represented in the NMRB shoe assemblage. One household lot––125 St. Clair Avenue—produced an exceptionally comprehensive sample that contains nearly all shoe-construction types present in the wider assemblage. This sample is discussed in light of developments in the shoe industry, the repair and maintenance of shoes, and the age and gender of the occupants at 125 St. Clair Avenue. Preferences for shoe style and particular shoe-construction types are also considered."
2018,Durham Boat––Defining a Vernacular Watercraft Type,"Durham boats were a vital part of eastern North American inland transportation during the 18th and 19th centuries, but are underrepresented in the archaeological record. The discovery of a 19th-century shipwreck in Oneida Lake, New York, that closely resembles historical Durham-boat descriptions allowed for an analysis of this vernacular vessel type. The Oneida Lake shipwreck is fully described and compared to primary historical accounts to establish it as an archaeological example of the Durham-boat type."
2018,Animal Husbandry and Colonial Adaptive Behavior: Isotopic Insights from the La Belle Shipwreck Fauna,"Changing social and economic practices had an important role for human adaptive strategies in colonial contexts and sometimes had profound consequences for emerging societies. This study uses insights from stable-isotope analyses, as well as other historical and archaeological evidence, to investigate the social and economic roles of French animal husbandry as an adaptive strategy for the settlers taking part in La Salle’s famous expedition (1684–1688) to colonize the mouth of the Mississippi River. Stable carbon- and nitrogen-isotope analyses of pig bones and other faunal remains from the shipwreck, La Belle, and associated Fort Saint Louis on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico are used to evaluate specific historical accounts of colonists’ animal-husbandry practices and show that a large swine population was sustained primarily on meat from local hunting activities. In this context it is argued that, although the substantial efforts involved in raising pigs mainly on other animal products seemingly makes little economic sense, there are social explanations for what initially appears to be irrational behavior. This study provides an example of how stable-isotope analyses of animal-husbandry practices can contribute to understanding social processes through historical archaeology."
2018,First Footsteps in a New World City: The Dunedin Causeway and Early Settlers’ Adaptation to Their New Home,"The Dunedin Causeway was a timber corduroy path found in central Dunedin, New Zealand, during an archaeological investigation ahead of a mall development in 2008. The path was probably built by the first Scottish settlers to arrive in 1848, using timber cleared from the neighboring hills. Analysis of the timbers indicates that they were almost all waste species and, therefore, ideal for use in a temporary path. Using a landscape-learning framework, this article suggests that the first settlers very quickly learned about certain aspects of their new home, and this knowledge was probably acquired from publications and assistance from the few existing residents, both European and Maori (the indigenous inhabitants of New Zealand). The causeway represents the early settlers’ physical efforts, their growing awareness of the landscape, the establishment of the city as an agent of colonization, and the acquisition of knowledge from local Maori, who were, perversely, being displaced by the same processes."
2018,Maroon Archaeology beyond the Americas: A View from Kenya,"Archaeological research on Maroons—that is, runaway slaves—has been largely confined to the Americas. This essay advocates a more global approach. It specifically uses two runaway slave communities in 19th-century coastal Kenya to rethink prominent interpretive themes in the field, including “Africanisms,” Maroons’ connections to indigenous groups, and Maroon group cohesion and identity. This article’s analysis demonstrates that the comparisons enabled by a more globalized perspective benefit the field. Instead of eliding historical and cultural context, these comparisons support the development of more localized and historically specific understandings of individual runaway slave communities both in Kenya and throughout the New World."
2018,A Practical Approach to the Chemical Analysis of Historical Materials,"Chemical analysis is an underused tool in historical archaeological investigations, despite the fact that much valuable information can be obtained from a chemical study of historical artifacts. Such analyses usually focus on the identification of materials, with the aim of elucidating their origins and historical uses. In a chemical sense, this proceeds through a number of stages, starting with simple observations and often ending with sophisticated measurements. It is work that can employ many different wet-chemical and instrumental methodologies, their use depending on both the analyst’s insights and the availability of equipment in the laboratory. It is important to recognize which instruments cannot be done without in the analytical process and which may be too costly to warrant the investment. The diverse nature of the samples often leads to methodological challenges, underscoring the uncertainties inherent in the chemical analysis of historical artifacts."
2018,"The Archaeology of Early African American Communities in Talbot County, Eastern Shore, Maryland, U.S.A., and Their Relationship to Slavery","A mid-19th-century deposit of circles and a wheel at Wye House on Maryland’s Eastern Shore may link the West African cosmogram to conversion to Christianity through the Methodist Episcopal and African Methodist Episcopal churches, which use the symbol of the wheel as representation of the movement to God. This interpretation would allow additional understanding of how enslaved and free Africans embraced new forms of Christianity. Creativity within slavery leads us to propose a way in which to write a new history of the Chesapeake region of Maryland. We also introduce M. I. Finley’s and Orlando Patterson’s ideas on the general conditions leading to and existing within slavery, so that we can consider how slavery appears, and dies in antiquity, and then reappears in North America. We propose a comparative definition of slavery that includes trafficking in human persons. We historical archaeologists can see a condition of society, that is part of our present, that recognizes the brutalizing dynamic within slavery and that can give way to creativity."
2018,"From Hell’s Gate to the Promised Land: Perspectives on Poverty in Saba, Dutch Caribbean, 1780 to the Mid-Twentieth Century","Archaeological research concerning poverty has expanded during the 21st century. Finding poverty in material things has become a challenge, and, consequently, research has been reoriented to understanding the social processes that produce and sustain poverty. Poverty is understood differently according to class and experienced differently according to scale, locality, race, and gender. By taking a whole-society approach to the small island of Saba, Dutch Caribbean, the materiality of Saba’s classes can be made visible if the social processes behind them can be revealed. Designating groups, individuals, and landscapes as “poor,” however, homogenizes these material vectors for projecting class. This gives poverty an ephemeral nature relative to those designating poverty to people and spaces. Therefore, poverty is best understood reflexively through powered perspectives and powered landscapes, rather than through a static pile of representative material objects."
2018,"In Search of the Hidden Irish: Historical Archaeology, Identity and “Irishness” in Nineteenth-Century South Australia","Dominant historical models for conceptualizing the Irish in Australia emphasize their ordinariness, characterizing them as largely indistinguishable from their British counterparts except in religious terms. In contrast, archaeological analyses of architecture, land use, graves, and personal items from three colonial sites in South Australia demonstrate forms of “Irishness” that distinguished the Roman Catholic and Protestant Irish as a collective from the non-Irish around them, while at the same time indicating the existence of sectarian tensions within the Irish community. Moreover, material markers created different forms of identity depending on their relative degree of fluidity and the context in which interaction took place. Markers associated with the close interpersonal territory of the body, such as buttons and jewelry, signaled conformity to a new, common habitus of capitalism, while more stable and less mobile markers, such as architecture and headstones, signaled abiding forms of both individual and group difference."
2018,Glass Beads and Spanish Shipwrecks: A New Look at Sixteenth-Century European Contact on the Florida Gulf Coast,"Despite the considerable amount of research devoted to the study of 16th-century contact between Native Americans and Spaniards in Florida, little attention has been given to the impact of Spanish shipwrecks on the lives and material culture of the Florida Indians. Spanish land-based expeditions are traditionally presented as the principal means of European contact with Native Americans in Florida and as the primary source for European objects, such as glass beads. This has created a misleading picture of what was really happening in Florida during the 16th century. Examination of Spanish sailing routes, the types of artifacts recovered archaeologically from the wreck sites of homebound Spanish ships, and salvage activities of the Florida Indians reveals that Spanish shipwrecks were probably responsible for most of the historical artifacts found on Florida archaeological sites with 16th-century European components. This suggests that the interactions between Spaniards and Florida Indians had a far greater intensity and complexity than has generally been supposed."
2018,"Artifacts, Contested Histories, and Other Archaeological Hotspots","As a contemporary act, historical archaeology must interweave past and present. This happens in a wide variety of locales, including field sites, classrooms, laboratories, and public venues. At every node of practice the charged fields of prior knowledge and archaeological expertise intersect and sometimes clash. This article explores such hotspots as they relate to the archaeology of World War II, drawing on the author’s experience leading a community-engaged research project at Amache, the site of a Japanese American internment camp during the war. Such research provides the opportunity to collaborate, not just with descendants, but also with survivors, people who once lived at the site under study. Such situations energize historical archaeology, but also destabilize the discipline, calling into question some of the archaeologist’s most basic tools, including terminology. Thoughtful contemporary engagements, however, can create new opportunities to expand conceptual frameworks."
2018,Returning to Amache: Former Japanese American Internees Assist Archaeological Research Team,"Dennis Fujita, a retired chemistry professor who was interned in the Granada (Amache) Relocation Center in southeastern Colorado, writes about his experience as a volunteer assisting University of Denver anthropology professor Bonnie J. Clark with the research at the Amache site."
2018,“Madonna del Prignioniero Prega per Noi”: An Intimate Archaeology of a World War II Italian Prisoner-of-War Camp,"Camp Monticello, located in southeast Arkansas, served as a prisoner-of-war camp for Italians from 1943 to 1946. The spatial arrangement of the camp, which consists of two officers’ compounds and three enlisted men’s compounds, was structured according to the central principles of surveillance, discipline, and control. The institution provided the inmates’ food, clothing, and possessions. From mess-hall menus to a chapel, archaeological research reveals intimate information about the men and the ways they worked together to maintain their cultural identities and regain some of their individuality."
2018,Remembering Camp Monticello: Researching a Documentary Film about My Father’s Time at Camp Monticello,"Silvia Bizio, an Italian journalist, and her son Matteo Borgardt are conducting research for a documentary film about Camp Monticello. She writes about working with local historians and historical archaeologists to learn about her father’s experiences at the camp."
2018,“Caring for Their Prisoner Compatriots”: Health and Dental Hygiene at the Kooskia Internment Camp,"Between 1943 and 1945, the Kooskia Internment Camp (KIC) in north central Idaho was home to 265 Japanese American men. As detainees of the U.S. Department of Justice, these individuals were treated as foreign prisoners of war and were therefore subject to the conditions of the 1929 Geneva Convention, which guaranteed the right to adequate health care. In 1943, the internees created a petition demanding improved health care and recreational opportunities. The remains of oral-hygiene products recovered archaeologically at Kooskia, such as toothpaste tubes, dentures, and mouthwash, and a review of wartime advertisements for these products suggests that dental health was a means of both assimilation into mainstream American culture and maintenance of Japanese ethnic character. This article examines the petition and dental artifacts as acts of “survivance” and “residence” by the Japanese American internees at Kooskia."
2018,Development of an Integrated Body-Glaze Layer on an 18th-Century Lead-Glazed True Porcelain Teapot from Philadelphia: Insights from Kiln Firing Experiments on Compositional Analogs,"A lead-glazed porcelain teapot with an aluminous-silicic body recovered from an 18th-century privy in Philadelphia developed a partly crystallized (alkali feldspar) integrated body-glaze layer (IBGL) during kiln firing. Experiments on compositional analogs of the teapot show that a mineralogically and microstructurally similar ware can be created by firing for 48 hours at a peak kiln temperature of 1370oC. An IBGL, also with alkali feldspars, formed between the glaze and its ceramic substrate during >5 hours firing at 1000oC. The IBGL formed as alkalis and lead fluxed the substrate. These results confirm that very high temperatures were required to vitrify aluminous-silicic (“true” or “hard paste”) porcelain pastes, and indicate that heat was not invariably dumped from the glost kiln as soon as lead-rich glazes melted. Although relatively aluminous, the uptake of alumina by the glaze was less than that shown by lead-rich glazes on phosphatic porcelain fired at lower temperatures (~1250oC), evidently because this component is largely sequestered in a relatively refractory mineral (mullite) in true porcelain."
2018,"Geophysical Investigation of Mission San Francisco Solano, Sonoma, California","Recent advances in mission archaeology advocate for studies beyond the mission church and quadrangle in order to better understand their spatial organizations and how they were embedded within the landscapes of indigenous populations. This raises the question of how to implement such studies in areas impacted for years by urban development, which has made it difficult to detect archaeological remains using standard pedestrian-survey methods. This article advocates for the use of geophysical survey as part of the mix of field strategies. Archaeologists undertook fieldwork at Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma, California, to assess the potential of employing geophysical-survey methods in contexts characterized by extensive post-mission reuse. The results indicate that ground-penetrating radar and resistivity surveys are capable of detecting earlier mission architectural remains that can be differentiated from the remains of post-mission urban development from the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
2018,“To Married Ladies It Is Peculiarly Suited”: Nineteenth-Century Abortion in an Archaeological Context,"Abortion was a lucrative business in the 19th century. Advertisements for services and patent-medicine abortifacients abounded and were targeted primarily at married, middle-class women engaged in family planning. Contemporary accounts suggest that one in five 19th-century pregnancies may have ended in abortion. Concerns over a potentially shifting demography prompted a backlash, and by the end of the century abortion was prohibited under most circumstances. Despite its widespread occurrence, archaeological evidence of abortion has been limited to a few documented cases, most notably the privy of the brothel at Five Points. The discovery of fetal remains and associated artifacts in two upstate New York domestic privies offers an opportunity to discuss the archaeology of abortion within the context of middle-class family planning, as well as the problems inherent in identifying abortion archaeologically."
2018,"Culturally Modified Red Pine, Birch-Bark Canoes, and the Strategic Geography of the Fur Trade on Lake Saganaga, Minnesota, U.S.A.","Culturally modified red pine (Pinus resinosa) can be added to the long list of natural and artificial features that comprise the cultural landscape of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness of Minnesota, U.S.A. This study provides historical context for the first cultural-modification dates derived from the dendrochronological evaluation of primary-growth, fire-killed red pine in the Border Lakes region. The tree-ring-based data are interpreted in the context of archaeological records, fur-trade era travel accounts, and ethnographic information to shed new light on the economy of the Border Lakes Ojibwe from the late 1700s to the early 1900s. Multiple lines of evidence from Lake Saganaga suggest that these culturally modified red pine were intentionally wounded in order to extract pitch, which was used to make the gum critical for constructing and repairing birch-bark canoes. Culturally modified red pine are a tangible artifact class that may serve to reframe modern perspectives on the critical role of the birch-bark canoe for transport in the historical Border Lakes landscape. These trees are living symbols of historical land-use patterns and are indicative of the strategic geography of the fur trade."
2018,"Small Beads, Big Picture: Assessing Chronology, Exchange, and Population Movement through Compositional Analyses of Blue Glass Beads from the Upper Great Lakes","As European explorers and displaced native newcomers entered the Upper Great Lakes region during the 17th and 18th centuries, they introduced unfamiliar material types, such as glass beads, that both local and non-local people incorporated into exchange networks and technological systems. Blue glass beads recovered at archaeological sites dating from A.D. 1630 to 1730 and attributed to historically documented peoples, Ho-Chunk, Potawatomi, Meskwaki, Tionontate-Wendat, Anishinaabeg, and other groups, were analyzed using a minimally invasive technique, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Identified patterns of variation in glass-bead composition reflect the timing and directions of trade among diverse communities, illustrating how a materials-science approach can reveal social and economic outcomes of intercultural interaction and colonialism. Since European-made glass trade beads circulated globally at this time, the results are comparable to those of beads from other regions worldwide for clarifying site chronologies and delineating broader patterns of material exchange."
2018,Cowboy Life along the Llano Estacado Eastern Escarpment of Northwest Texas: Insights from Macy Locality 16 (41GR722),"Cattle ranching is an important part of the heritage of the American West, yet few archaeological studies focus on this industry. Many aspects of ranching-related work are ephemeral, leaving on the landscape only small traces of these past activities. Survey on an historical ranch (established 1882) along the eastern escarpment of the Llano Estacado has identified a short-term cowboy camp at Macy Locality 16 (41GR722). Metal-detector survey and excavation has delineated camping activities alongside a chuck wagon and the remains of a temporary corral. Historical documents, composition of the site’s artifact assemblage, and its position on the landscape indicate the occupation was a ca. 1882–1901 roundup camp. This study demonstrates the importance of contextualizing ephemeral ranching-related sites within the broader organization of ranching activities across the landscape."
2018,"Frontiers and Fortlets in the Pampa Region, Argentina","Research on fortified military sites has been significant in Argentinean historical archaeology since its beginnings in the 1990s. This study of five mid-19th-century, contemporaneous outpost fortlets from the Southern Frontier area of the Pampa region exemplifies a new perspective on the traditional historical view focused on chronology and the definition of the military line of the frontier. It also improves the understanding of the fortlets by providing original interpretations regarding their materiality (settlement pattern, architecture, provision of goods and circulation, and social interaction, among others). Furthermore, archaeological perspectives have proven meaningful, not only in terms of material culture, but also in documentary research, by providing an anthropological interpretation of written and graphic sources, setting a new agenda for the study of fortlets and frontiers in the Pampa region."
2018,Dining with the Madisons: Elite Consumption at Montpelier,"Recent research at James Madison’s Montpelier permits exploration of shifts in cuisine practices relating to the emergence of American cultural sensibilities, as well as in response to the greater international visibility and increased social and economic status of the household following Madison’s term as United States president. Prior to the presidency, zooarchaeological remains indicate that the household consumed high-quality cuts of meat from domesticated livestock, but that wild game also contributed significantly to the diet. After the presidency, costly meat cuts continued to be served on a well-appointed Madison table, but the overall diversity of the meat-based portion of the diet was reduced. The household increasingly focused its dietary strategy on a few locally produced, high-quality meats, likely in order to efficiently feed the many guests that visited Montpelier. Although English and French elite influences on cuisine are visible in the written record and material culture from Montpelier, the zooarchaeological evidence reflects the emergence of a distinctly American cuisine."
2018,"Foodways at a Colonial Military Frontier Outpost in Northern New Spain: The Faunal Assemblage from Presidio San Sabá, 1757–1772","An 18th-century colonial settlement, Presidio San Sabá was the largest and, indeed, the most remote military frontier outpost within the Spanish Borderlands of northern New Spain in Texas. Garrisoned with 100 Spanish soldiers who resided there with their civilian families, the presidio numbered nearly 400 people. Historical records reveal that this resident population lived under adverse conditions, suffering from malnutrition, disease, and chronic shortages of food and other supplies. Analysis of the faunal assemblage recovered during archaeological excavations conducted at the presidio site indicates that the San Sabá people managed to survive by subsisting primarily upon the food products of their livestock herds. Moreover, they secured some additional animal protein for their diet by occasionally trading, fishing, hunting, and collecting locally available natural resources."
2018,Fair-as-Foodway: Culinary Worlds and Modernizing Tastes at Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition,"The 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago from May to October, hosted 27 million people who experienced the encyclopedic world of the past, present, and imagined future on display in the space of a single site. The restaurants and food-related exhibits of the fair introduced new modes of consumption, while literally sustaining tourists and workers alike. Individual consumption at the Chicago Fair would have been mediated by a person’s ethnicity, class, race, and gender, as well as emerging access to increasingly industrialized, urban food systems. Historical, archival, and archaeological research at Chicago’s Jackson Park, the former site of the fair, reveal some of the most pervasive legacies of these foodways."
2018,Made in France? Seventeenth-Century French Clay Pipes in North American Contexts,"Archaeologists and historians have largely dismissed the possibility that products of the nascent French clay-pipe industry were used by North American consumers during the 17th century. However, a recent examination of pipe assemblages from sites in Newfoundland—combined with close scrutiny of previously reported finds from Champlain’s Habitation, Fort La Tour, and Fort Pentagoet—suggest that small numbers of French-made decorated pipes were consumed by individuals in New France and, in some cases, by those at nearby English settlements. A novel approach to identifying some 17th-century French products is presented, based on an amalgam of attributes, including motifs/symbols, clay fabric, and inclusions. The results are viewed as an important first step in deciphering the mechanisms and motivations behind the procurement and use of decorated French pipes in New World contexts."
2018,"Clay Tobacco-Pipe Research and Historical Archaeology in Germany, a Difficult Relationship","Clay tobacco-pipe studies played an important, yet unacknowledged, role in the formation process of historical archaeology in Germany. Systematic analyses of smoking utensils and the craftsmanship involved in making them were the forerunners of the academic discipline. Clay-pipe studies were never restricted by disciplinary boundaries. Methods and approaches were drawn from ethnology, archaeology, and history, but the field remained purely Eurocentric. However, clay-pipe research has come to a halt. One important reason for this is its high degree of specialization. But, otherwise, historical archaeology is currently on the upswing, despite its unsatisfying engagement with material culture, especially that of the late 18th century onwards. This article illustrates the development and demise of clay-pipe research in Germany in the context of the emergence of historical archaeology as a discipline. It includes elements in common with clay-pipe research in the United States and in Britain, and it also highlights significant differences."
2018,Marine Shell and Small-Island Slavery in the Caribbean,"Caribbean slavery on plantations perched on very small islands that could be only a few dozen acres in extent was likely very different from slavery on the major islands. This article considers the results from three years of excavation and survey on the 150 ac. island of Little Jost van Dyke, British Virgin Islands, focusing on a cotton-farming plantation occupied by both free and enslaved people from about 1720 to 1790. The questions of oversight and control, as well as access to resources—frequent topics in plantation archaeology that are somewhat different here—frame the discussion of the limits and advantages of small islands and the effects of these on daily life and the structure of communities. A particular focus is given to the data provided by the study of marine-shell ecofacts recovered in the excavations and what these data can reveal about foodways, economy, and movement around the landscape. The article concludes that those enslaved on such smaller islands often had certain opportunities for movement and economic improvement denied those on larger or landlocked sites, but also serves as a reminder that these opportunities could not counter the impacts of enslavement."
2018,The Application of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) in Historical Archaeology,"Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is a technique for the production of images in the lab or field that allows for the recording and analysis of artifacts so that their surfaces can be investigated more fully than with traditional visual inspection or photography. Using standard photographic equipment and freely available software, images can be generated for recording, analysis, publication, public interpretation, and conservation purposes. This report results from innovative trials of the technique and reveals its potential for widespread application within historical archaeology for investigating many artifact categories including clay pipes, molded glass, gravestones, and bone and copper alloy artifacts."
2018,"Markers of Difference or Makers of Difference? Atypical Practices at Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Satellite Sites, ca. 1650–1700","This article examines social pluralism within politically autonomous 17th-century Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) communities. Haudenosaunee groups are known to have incorporated significant numbers of outsiders by processes of individual and group adoption. This article assesses the dynamics of social difference by looking at atypical practices in satellite communities in Seneca, Cayuga, and Mohawk territories. While previous scholars equated such practices with the presence of outsiders, atypical practices and the identities and labor relations associated with them are worth considering in a more fluid sense. Who would have continued, discontinued, or adopted practices that stood out from those of the majority? What sort of social roles or inequities went along with these sorts of distinctions? Documentary and archaeological data from these satellite communities suggest that social difference was pronounced in mortuary ritual, but muted in domestic settings, and that these differences were unlikely to reflect substantial social inequality."
2018,"Created Communities: Segregation and the History of Plural Sites on Eastern Long Island, New York","The making of communities is often treated as a quasi-natural process in which people of similar backgrounds and heritage, or people living in close proximity, form meaningful and mutual ties. Missing here is an appreciation of the ties that bind people to others, that are often beyond their own control. Especially in contexts of inequality, communities form because of shared interests in perpetuating, dismantling, or simply surviving the structures of an unequal distribution of resources. This article investigates the formation of communities of color on eastern Long Island since the 18th century by looking at intersections between race and settlement as evidence for how people of color worked within and against the systems that controlled them. A foundational component of the region’s working class, intersecting patterns in class and race formation that complicate the understanding of these mixed-heritage Native American and African American communities are considered."
2018,Survivance Strategies and the Materialities of Mashantucket Pequot Labor in the Later Eighteenth Century,"Scholars in New England have long been puzzled by the mixed materialities of colonial period Indian homes. Variously interpreted as a strategy for survival, a reflection of cultural loss, or as representations of continuity and change, these sites and their assemblages remain undertheorized. This article focuses on three sites from the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Reservation in southeastern Connecticut, dating between the 1740s/1750s and the 1780s. By considering the differences among them, archaeologists can begin working toward new understandings of Pequot Indian survivance. That research pathway starts with a reconsideration of Indian work in the 1700s, in which household subsistence labor is distinguished from household surplus labor and labor products from labor time. This tactic allows for more in-depth, contextual studies of furnishings and foodways, in which the differences amongst site assemblages become clues to changing reservation ecologies, social exchange networks beyond the reservation, everyday household rhythms, and acts of “quiet defiance.”"
2018,Late Modernity and Community Change in Lattimer No. 2: The American Twentieth Century as Seen through the Archaeology of a Pennsylvania Anthracite Town,"The shanty town at the periphery of Lattimer No. 2 began in the 1880s as an ephemeral settlement for new immigrant workers. Situated within the pluralist labor hierarchy of northeast Pennsylvania’s coal region, Italian families created a community here at the edge of an ethnically diverse, but spatially divided, company-town landscape. Here, and in places across the nation, the 20th century brought about transformations in the intimate relationships among individuals, economies, and the state. Giorgio Agamben proposes that the dominant paradigm of this political economy is materialized in places like the shantytown, paradoxical spaces in which “law and fact ... have become indistinguishable,” and individuals exist within “a constant state of exception.” Archaeology conducted in the shanty enclave of Lattimer No. 2, viewed through the long duration of the 20th-century political economy, illuminates this formation through its materialization of shifting landscapes, buildings, and boundaries."
2018,The Plurality of Parting Ways: Landscapes of Dependence and Independence and the Making of a Free African American Community in Massachusetts,"Parting Ways was a plural space shaped by multiple social and historical forces that combined to reinforce its residents’ dependence on the dominant society, while simultaneously affording the creation a “homeplace” for its residents, within which to construct their lives as free people. Such plurality highlights tension between African American freedom and processes of racialization in 19th-century Massachusetts: the Parting Ways residents labored as free men and women, but found their efforts controlled by the White community, and they created an autonomous homeplace on land that continued to be owned and controlled by town officials. This article explores how the physical landscape and property history of Parting Ways and social relationships between the residents and Plymouth elite contributed to the perpetuation of relationships of dependency; it also uses archaeological evidence to examine how the formerly enslaved residents at Parting Ways constructed autonomous households that supported individual, family, and community independence."
2018,"Homeplace Is also Workplace: Another Look at Lucy Foster in Andover, Massachusetts","Racialized captive labor in Massachusetts was carried into the 19th- and early 20th-century landscape. Data from the census on the occupations of people in households were limited until 1850. Women’s labor was invisible. Yet, it is known that the labor of women required a plurality of roles and functions. This is especially true for African American women, who, with limited opportunities for employment, often found themselves in the same working relationships they had in captivity. Lucy Foster, in Andover, Massachusetts, was one such individual. As a captive African and a free person of color, Miss Foster performed many undocumented duties in her lifetime. However, when her archaeological assemblage is analyzed in light of the plurality of labor duties required to maintain a household and the census data for people of color in Andover, the daily life of a single Black woman emerges. Lucy’s large ceramic collection might be indicative of a focal point in the African American community for religious and national holidays and Black commemoration celebrations."
2018,"Muffled, but not Mute","Narratives of Long Island’s past continue to efface the many Native American, African, and mixed-heritage workers from its plural past. Many of the homes and farms White families shared with their coerced, waged, and non-White workers remain rife with archaeological potential, yet archaeologists are reluctant to excavate them, presumably because of their ambiguity and lack of culturally distinct data. This article examines changing labor relations in order to repopulate these plural sites and give meaning to the many objects, practices, and spaces diverse people shared on a daily basis. An 18th- and 19th-century farmstead provides the context. Specifically, domestic architecture and activities are traced across the transition from slavery to wage labor to determine how new relations unfolded in daily practice. The results indicate that the system of wage labor preserved White authority over non-White workers and contributed to the masking of plural spaces as homogeneously White."
2018,Laboring under an Illusion: Aligning Method and Theory in the Archaeology of Plantation Slavery,"A rich body of thought—developed by archaeologists and others—points the way toward dynamic understandings of who humans are, yet archaeology struggles to be more than a handmaiden. Arguably, the problem is one of method rather than theory: what counts as data, how we archaeologists categorize things, and what our problems are. This paper examines labor relations in the early Virginia colony via locally made clay tobacco pipes. These artifacts, often treated as emblems of ethnic identity, are here used to understand a society in the process of transforming its pluralities into the categories that we take for granted."
2018,Corduroy-Road Archaeology in Cultural and Historical Context: A Case Study from the New York Frontier,"A construction crew uncovered a late 18th-century corduroy road during a habitat-improvement project for the New York Power Authority. The dendrochronological age and road alignment imply surveyors built the road in the rush to settle New York’s frontier. A comparison with other corduroy roads during the Section 106 compliance process uncovered very few well-documented examples. Historical accounts suggest that corduroy roads were a common landscape feature, but one that held sometimes contradictory meanings depending on the context. Subsequent research into corduroy-road archaeology identified patterns and shortcomings in the study of this technology, especially concerning the treatment of these sites in a cultural resource management (CRM) context. Some consideration of corduroy-road potential can be accomplished at the earliest stages of archaeological survey by identifying favorable environmental and historical factors. The research potential is considerable and contributes to a better model of past environments and cultural landscapes in a frontier setting."
2018,"Sucreries and Ziizbaakdokaanan: Racialization, Indigenous Creolization, and the Archaeology of Maple-Sugar Camps in Northern Michigan","Comparison of the remains on four northern Michigan archaeological sites with ethnohistorical accounts of maple sugaring confirms the function of these sites, occupied between the late 18th and late 19th centuries. All include charcoal deposits and artifacts associated with open-fire sap boiling in kettles, and three sites are notable for faunal remains dominated by fish and essentially without large mammals, wild or domestic. The sites’ archaeological characteristics contradict historical accounts that used racial terms, such as ""Indian,"" ""white,"" and ""half-breed,"" to differentiate sugar makers and racialize both their practices and products. Instead, archaeological and historical evidence of sugaring can be explained by a process called “indigenous creolization.” This concept facilitates the balanced recognition of Native American (mainly Anishinaabe) and European (mainly French Canadian) influences on maple sugaring without reproducing colonial classifications based on race or racialized ethnicity."
2018,"The Virtual Fort Ross Project: Architectural Reconstruction of Settlement Ross, Sonoma County, California","Historical archaeologists like to apply their findings based on a combination of their excavation results and documentary research to reconstruct, at least in their mind’s eye, or preferably in the form of a drawing, structures that once existed. Although in some cases there are the financial resources available to reconstruct these buildings, it is rare that more than a very few can actually be brought back to life. Thanks to the wonders of digital imagery, it is now possible to formulate a whole landscape permitting a visitor to enter into this reimagined scene. This is best achieved by a close collaboration of historical archaeology and documentary research."
2017,Historical Archaeology in Southeast Asia,"Historical archaeology in Southeast Asia can be divided into two periods: the classic era of the Hindu and Buddhist civilizations, which began approximately 2,000 years ago, and the postclassic era, which began around A.D. 1400 with the expansion of Islam and Theravada Buddhism, followed by the arrival of European colonists in the 16th century. The use of “historical archaeology” to refer to this 2,000-year-long period differs from the sense of the term used in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and North America, where historical archaeology is normally applied to the last 500 years. This essay describes the attitudes toward the transition from antiquity to the present from the perspective of archaeology in various parts of Southeast Asia. The main focus is on the perspective of local archaeologists, rather than those from outside the region."
2017,"“Should We Have Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata ... or a Hot Dinner?” Resource Stress as an Alternative to the Abandonment of Peel Town, Swan River Colony, 1829–1830","Peel town, one of many coastal camps established with the 1829 British colonization of the Swan River in the southwest of Australia, collapsed after 11 months of hardship. It has been long considered that dislike of the camp’s leader, Thomas Peel, was the main reason for the abandonment of the camp. However, the analysis of charcoal from hearths, fireplaces, and ash pits associated with five dwellings from the camp suggests that, during their stay, colonists exhausted local wood as fuel, forcing them to use timber containers, furniture, and ships’ timbers as firewood. The results propose that colonists were under extreme resource stress, which contributed to the camp’s abandonment."
2017,The Archaeology of the Wood Pottery: Confounding the “Industrial” Transformation of Southern Stoneware Production after Edgefield,"The post–Civil War decades of the 19th and early 20th centuries are the period most commonly associated with the origins of industrialization in the southeastern United States. Recently, however, researchers working in Edgefield, South Carolina, have presented compelling archaeological evidence for the industrial production of stoneware, much of it made by enslaved laborers, as early as 1810. These findings require reconsideration of the widely shared historical narrative that portrays 19th-century stoneware potteries in Edgefield and across the region as small-scale family-owned craft enterprises, where industrialization did not occur until a decade or more after the Civil War as a response to competition from cheap Northern stoneware and metal and glass containers. Inspired by the new insights, this study traces stoneware production in the Edgefield area forward into the 20th century by examining the case of the Wood Pottery site in North Augusta, South Carolina. Based on archaeological and historical evidence, three significant changes to stoneware production methods are traced: (1) changes in firing technology; (2) a switch from alkaline glaze to Albany slip; and (3) morphological changes in the vessel assemblages marking the use of jigger arms and molds. Instead of a “vertical” historical trajectory that moves from a craft to an industrialized enterprise, we envision these changes as part of a “horizontal” shift in an already-industrialized enterprise, reflecting a reorganization of labor and technology aimed at coping with competition from alternative storage-vessel forms and the loss of an enslaved workforce."
2017,A Comparison of Ethnicity and Tuberculosis in the Historic Southeast,"The prevalence and occurrence of tuberculosis can be attributed to a number of intrinsic factors, including sex, age, and ethnicity, as well as extrinsic factors, such as socioeconomic standing, occupation, and nutrition. Evidence of a severe infection, recovered during the 2007 salvage excavation of Foster Cemetery in Lawrence County, Alabama, is presented. Recorded within an African American cemetery population, the tuberculosis case is placed into an historical and regional context through comparison with other 19th- and 20th-century African American and European American cemetery populations in the southeastern United States. Extrapulmonary skeletal tuberculosis frequencies within comparative populations are examined, and the relationship between ethnicity and tuberculosis is assessed. It can be determined that not only does this relationship exist, but it is also one of statistical significance, suggesting that, historically, African American populations had a higher occurrence of tuberculosis than European American populations."
2017,First Archaeological Evidence for Old World Crops in the Caribbean: The Presence of Barley on the Island of Barbuda,"As part of the Barbuda Historical Ecology Project, in 2010 and 2011 two historical sites on the island of Barbuda (Antigua and Barbuda) were sampled for archaeobotanical macroremains. Charred cereal grains found at the Castle (17th and 18th centuries) and Highland House sites (1720 to 19th century) were identified as hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare). These remains are the earliest archaeological evidence of European cereals in the Caribbean, and this raises questions about their origin. Strontium-isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analysis was performed on a seed from the Castle and produced a value of 0.7115, beyond the bioavailable strontium-isotope range expected from the West Indies, strongly suggesting importation of this cereal to the island. This analysis, combined with a discussion of imports and exports cited in historical documents, sheds new light on British foodways on Barbuda."
2017,Metric Properties of Sundials using 3-D Models from Digital Photography,"Three-dimensional (3-D) models of archaeological artifacts can be obtained using free or low-cost image-based modeling (IBM) systems. IBM systems generate a 3-D model by processing a set of overlapping digital photographs of an object or scene. Sundials are generally located in inaccessible places, and photography may be the only method to study them. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of the 3-D modeling of archaeological objects obtained by IBM systems and embedded in a 3-D interactive portable document format (PDF) file. The process is illustrated by two case studies: a Roman sundial and a historical vertical sundial. The 3-D interactive PDF file allows for measuring some elements in the 3-D model. These measurements can be obtained easily and provide metric information about the sundials without touching them."
2017,Drone Mapping and Photogrammetry at Brandon House 4,"As consumer-grade drones have become increasingly sophisticated and readily accessible, their potential for noninvasive archaeological site investigation has become evident. The Brandon House 4 case study evaluates the consistency of drone photogrammetric output with conventional site maps, whether geographic information systems (GIS) processing of that imagery improves analytic insight, and how such approaches can aid noninvasive site investigation. Field tests demonstrate the cost effectiveness of drone aerial photography, particularly when used with semiautonomous flight planning software. More significantly, when enhanced using GIS the scaled and georeferenced photogrammetric output aids interpretation of archaeological sites and features."
2017,The Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project: Overview of Methods and Tools,"The Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project was not intended to be a full recovery and documentation of an historical shipwreck 1220 m (4,000 ft.) below the surface, rather, it was a mitigation of impacts in order to comply with federal law. The principal goal was to reduce the surface visibility of the site while documenting the archaeological provenience of the artifacts and determining, as much as possible, the age, cultural affiliation, function, and historical significance of the site. This goal dictated the method of data recovery and the tools selected to meet the objective. In an extreme environment, where such a project had never been attempted before, methods and tools had to be adapted to meet the challenge. Some of the methods were successful and others were not. Ultimately, the project succeeded in its mission, and both successes and failures have informed subsequent archaeological recovery work in very deep water."
2017,"Mercantilism, Warfare, or Privateering? Providing the Historical Context for the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Site","The Gulf of Mexico played an important role in the power struggles between Europe and the United States for control of access to valuable resources in North and South America. Spain, France, Great Britain, and the burgeoning United States utilized this vast body of water to jockey for positions of power, especially for control of New Orleans. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries these countries wrangled for control of the Gulf through treaty, trade, warfare, and privateering. Serving many different roles, ships engaged in transporting commodities, protecting places and resources, and antagonizing rivals. Between wars, commercial competition, and disasters at sea, many vessels were lost to the depths of the Gulf. One such vessel, the Mardi Gras Shipwreck, may have served in one or more of these roles during its career. By examining the historical record, archaeologists can reconstruct the sociocultural, political, and economic milieus to establish the historical context in which the shipwreck and its story reside."
2017,"Land, Ho! Maritime Navigation through the Early Nineteenth Century as Represented by the Mardi Gras Shipwreck","At the time the vessel referred to as the Mardi Gras Shipwreck sailed (estimated to be between 1808 and 1820), advances in the tools used for accurate navigation on the open ocean had transformed navigation from an art to a science. Access to materials, the formation of merchant guilds, and a demand for more-accurate navigation tools due to increases in vessel losses, which coincided with the increase of exploration and exploitation during the 17th and 18th centuries, all contributed to instrument improvements. The navigation equipment identified on the Mardi Gras Shipwreck provides a glimpse of the indispensable tools used to successfully navigate the open ocean in the early 19th century."
2017,Analysis of the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Ship’s Stove,"Recent discoveries in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico yielded tantalizing clues about the complex maritime history of the region. In particular, the Mardi Gras Shipwreck site, located in 1220 m (4,000 ft.) of water, contained an astonishing array of material culture. Of particular interest is a ship’s stove, one of only a handful identified in archaeological contexts. An assessment of the stove and its construction provided insight into the use of stoves at sea. Further, analysis of this appliance and comparison to similar stoves from archaeological contexts suggests that a veritable “cottage industry” may have existed throughout U.S. and international port communities and blacksmith shops. Historical research revealed the various functions that ships’ stoves performed in the early 19th century. In addition, this investigation serves as a platform for addressing larger research questions about foodways and human behavior exhibited on sailing vessels in the late 18th and early 19th centuries."
2017,The Glass and Ceramic Assemblage of the Mardi Gras Shipwreck,"The Mardi Gras Shipwreck, the remains of an approximately 16 m (52 ft.) long vessel that sank roughly 65 km (40 mi.) southeast of the Mississippi Delta during the early 19th century, yielded a substantial number of intact and nearly intact glass and ceramic artifacts. The majority of the glass and ceramic artifacts consists of bottles and creamware tableware, but other items, such as stoneware jugs and an inkwell, are also present. Analysis of the glass and ceramic artifacts helped to date the shipwreck and provided insights regarding consumer choice and shipboard life in the 19th-century Gulf of Mexico."
2017,Artillery and Arms from the Mardi Gras Shipwreck,"Limited excavation and video examination of the Mardi Gras Shipwreck revealed that the vessel carried at least one cannon and a collection of arms and munitions at the time of its loss. A large portion of the recovered arms assemblage was contained within a large composite concretion believed to represent part of the magazine. This unique artifact, in addition to other evidence from the site, suggests this assemblage was not cargo, but intended for ship’s use. Viewed within the complex arena of naval affairs in the Gulf of Mexico, which included formal naval vessels, informally outfitted vessels of emerging navies, privateers, pirates, and defensively armed merchantman, the interpretation of this collection is not absolute, but suggestive of privateering. Study of this collection, and the few similar shipwrecks in the Gulf of Mexico, is building a framework for understanding such sites within the context of Gulf history."
2017,The Conservation Research Laboratory and Conservation of Artifacts from the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project,"Conservation of artifacts from underwater archaeological sites is vital, and the role of the Conservation Research Laboratory (CRL) is to ensure the artifacts’ long-term stabilization. Conservation serves several purposes, not the least of which is protecting the tangible remnants of a particular site. These artifacts aid in identification of the site, provide details of the activities of the people inhabiting the site, and also provide the archaeologist, and ultimately the public, with a connection between the past and the present."
2017,"Lights, Camera ... Shipwreck!?! Multimedia at Four Thousand Feet","On 20 May 2007, filmmakers from Nautilus Productions joined the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project archaeological team from Texas A&M University (TAMU) and the Minerals Management Service (MMS) to document the Mardi Gras Shipwreck site. The technology-driven project required the Nautilus Productions crew to complete a few simple tasks: document everything from the time the project vessel left Port Fourchon, Louisiana, until the conservation of the artifacts was completed at TAMU, and then create an educational documentary and Web video about the effort for the Louisiana State Museum, the MMS, and TAMU. The film crew worked alongside the archaeological team, ship’s crew, and remotely operated vehicle pilots throughout 24 hr. shifts, recording the decisions, research design, and research as it happened. Nautilus Production’s mission was simple: document the project and allow the archaeology to speak for itself. It is the purpose of this article to show how electronic and digital media can assist in documenting an archaeological site, support project goals, and enhance public education during and after the project."
2017,Deep Thoughts: A Look at Public Access to Deepwater Sites through the Mardi Gras Shipwreck,"In late 2006, the Florida Public Archaeology Network (FPAN) was asked by the Minerals Management Service to direct the public outreach and education component of the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project. Traditional public outreach efforts for archaeological sites in shallow water typically focus on getting diving and snorkeling visitors to the site. Interpretive materials for such sites often include waterproof site plans, submerged markers, and guidelines to direct visitors around the site as they explore and learn. Deepwater archaeological sites present unique challenges, namely, the interpretation of resources managed for the public that the public will never physically visit. This article discusses FPAN’s role in the Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project and the public education strategies developed to present the shipwreck and the extreme deepwater project to the public."
2017,Spaces of Entanglement: Labor and Construction Practice at Fort San Juan de Joara,"An analysis of architectural remains reveals changes in both construction practice and the organization of labor during the occupation of Fort San Juan de Joara, located at the Berry site in present-day North Carolina. This fort and its associated domestic area, referred to as the Spanish compound, were established in December 1566 by Captain Juan Pardo and constitute the earliest European settlement in the interior of what is now the United States. Excavations in Structures 1 and 5, built at different times in the compound’s 18-month occupation, recovered well-preserved remains of wooden construction elements, with some displaying evidence of cutting and preparation with metal tools. Focusing on wood selection and wood preparation, we show that construction labor through the early phase of the Spanish occupation was divided between settler and indigenous host communities; later, however, as relations between these groups deteriorated, so did indigenous participation in Spanish construction projects."
2017,"The Edges of Wood: Dendrochronological Analysis of Three Seneca Iroquois Log Structures at Letchworth State Park, New York","Letchworth State Park in Castile, New York, maintains the Caneadea Council House, the Nancy Jemison Cabin, and Thomas “Buffalo Tom” Jemison Cabin, all built in Seneca communities along the Genesee River valley in the early 19th century. Dendrochronological analysis of samples from these structures has provided a more precise construction date of ca. 1820 for the council house, significantly later than the 1759–1780 range derived from historical documents. However, the results support the historical construction dates of around 1800 for the Nancy Jemison Cabin and ca. 1818 for the Thomas Jemison Cabin. Applying K. Jordan’s (2008) intercultural/creolized type and Brown’s (2000) “Reservation Log House” type along with the lens of hybridity elucidates how the council house and cabins relate to Seneca decisions to incorporate principles of European-style log construction into their longhouse and other building forms in adaptation to their more confined territory and increased European American settlement and infrastructure building at that time."
2017,"Crib Girls and Clients in the Red-Light District of Ouray, Colorado: Class, Gender, and Dress","An examination of dress-related artifacts from the Vanoli block (5OR30), a sporting complex in Ouray, Colorado, indicates that the prostitutes, working in the cribs on the block, and their clients dressed in clothing that was thoroughly working class. This conclusion contrasts with previous research on brothel assemblages that has demonstrated that the madams and prostitutes who resided in such establishments purchased relatively expensive items of clothing and decor that were not consumed by their working-class neighbors. An examination of the sartorial choices made by the women and men on the Vanoli block, from the perspective of practice and performance theory, suggests that they were shaped by the specific conjunction of class and gender politics that characterized Western mining towns at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries."
2017,"“Built on Christian Principles”: Archaeologies of St. Mary’s Hall, a New Jersey Female Seminary","The archaeology of academic institutions provides an opportunity to examine gender construction, women’s education, and identity creation. Documentary, landscape, institutional, and gender archaeologies were all employed in the examination of a 19th-century female seminary in Burlington City, Burlington County, New Jersey. Originally operating as a Quaker female seminary between 1829 and 1836, the school was later purchased by Bishop George Washington Doane in 1837 and reconstituted as an Episcopalian secondary school for teenage girls, known as St. Mary’s Hall. It continues to operate today, though as a coeducational institution known as Doane Academy. Archaeology at St. Mary’s Hall/Doane Academy sheds light on 19th-century academic curricula, institutional goals, female agency, and the ways students negotiated the discipline of boarding-school life as they strove to create their own identities and forge important friendships. Data examined include archived student letters, annual institution catalogs and registers, recovered school supplies, existing and former school buildings, and discarded personal items."
2017,The North Dakota Man Camp Project: The Archaeology of Home in the Bakken Oil Fields,"Over the past three years (2012–2015), the North Dakota Man Camp Project has documented the archaeology of home in over 50 contemporary, short-term, workforce-housing sites in the Bakken oil patch in western North Dakota. This article integrates recent scholarship in global urbanism, archaeology of the contemporary past, and domesticity to argue that the expansion of temporary-workforce housing in the Bakken reflects a global periphery that lacks infrastructure or capital to respond rapidly to the pressures of an increasingly fluid movement of global capital and labor. The position of the Bakken produced short-term housing strategies that embrace both traditions of American domesticity and global trends in informal urbanism. A series of practical acts of architectural intervention straddle the line between the ideals of fixity characteristic of the American suburb and the mobility of recreational vehicles. The archaeological and architectural analysis of the Bakken man camps documents new forms of informal housing and offers a glimpse of the city yet to come."
2017,Creating a User-Friendly Interactive Interpretive Resource with ESRI’s ArcGIS Story Map Program,"The introduction of new technologies to archaeology brings opportunities for making archaeological work more accessible to the public. The ESRI ArcGIS platform has facilitated this effort and offers exciting ways to do this, including the ESRI Story Map program. Part of the cloud-based ArcGIS Online platform, the Story Map application allows for the integration of narratives, images, and maps in a user-friendly format. A collaborative effort led by Montclair State University has applied this technology to Dr. Christopher Matthews’s work with Higher Ground Intercultural and Heritage Association in Setauket, New York, to counter the dominant historical narrative of the town that neglects the contributions and very existence of a strong and long-standing community of Native American and African American people. Many of the results of this project are presented in the case study discussed here: “A Counter-Map of Setauket, New York.” This article explains how this counter-map was created in the hope that other archaeologists may apply this technology to their own work."
2017,Where Tradition and Pragmatism Meet: African Diaspora Archaeology at the Crossroads,"The trope of “tradition” dominates archaeological studies of the African diaspora. Much of the information archaeologists have about traditions on the African continent or in the early diaspora comes from historical documents and from ethnography. Here, the author argues that pragmatism provides a model for analysis that allows archaeology a degree of independence from these allied datasets. Archaeologists, like other social scientists, confront the problem of the relative importance of social learning (i.e., tradition) vs. structure as forces shaping cultural expression in the African diaspora. An analytical strategy inspired by pragmatism is here applied to beads recovered from Tidewater Chesapeake slave quarters occupied in the 18th and early 19th centuries in order to demonstrate that tradition is only part of the story"
2017,Materialities of Homeplace,"In this article, I discuss a semiotic approach to thinking archaeologically about the processes of racialization in the African diaspora. Within this, I employ the concept of “homeplace” as an archaeological, ideological, and memorial site. I situate my archaeological narrative in persistence rather than resistance, highlighting how narratives of persistence allow for and empower social agency in the past not solely situated in or responsive to systems of oppression."
2017,Homesick Blues: Excavating Crooked Intimacies in Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Jook Joints,"This article traverses the bittersweet antagonisms of home and disorienting counter-privates inhabited by Black laborers during the decades following U.S. Reconstruction. I chart the inception of modern African American homes and the disorderly stages that queered homeliness. Drawing from snippets of oral history, blues lyrics, archival documents, and photographs, I excavate the material and spatial fabric of Black homes and their unruly counterparts—jook houses. This article facilitates a cross-disciplinary engagement with affect theory, queer theory, and ontological approaches to materiality in an attempt to understand how jook atmospheres generated disruptive intimacies. In doing so, this article examines how a coalescence of crooked bodies and homesick feelings threatened to throw the order of home into chaos. The assemblage of performers and materials that once resided in these rural spaces crafts a focal point for understanding the transformative possibilities of pleasure erupting in queer Black histories."
2017,"Cruise Ships, Community, and Collective Memory at Millars Plantation, Eleuthera, Bahamas","Tourism is a central part of contemporary Bahamian life. Yet, the complex relationship between Bahamian cultural identity and dependency on the tourism industry has also created an interesting space for resistance for many Bahamian communities. Incorporating Black feminist archaeological theory and a community-collaborative approach, this project has provided a plausible alternative interpretation of the larger effects of the remnants of the colonial past, the contemporary tourist economy, and the complicated relationship between developing cultural heritage sites in the region and the needs of local community members. The Millars Plantation, in the southern region of the island of Eleuthera, provided the research team an opportunity to explore, through oral history and small-scale memory mapping, a concentrated view of how the plantation landscape operated as a site of captivity, then a site of survival, and ultimately a space of ancestral connection between people, history, landscapes, and contemporary tourism."
2017,Locating Marginalized Historical Narratives at Kingsley Plantation,"I am interested in locating marginalized historical narratives at Kingsley Plantation, searching the landscape for what McKittrick (2006:133) calls “demonic grounds,” the grounds that locate “the complex position and potentiality of black women’s sense of place” and are understood not as erased, but disavowed. Complexity is disavowed at Kingsley Plantation, and in its place is the implementation of truncated historical narratives reaching for unobtainable cohesion. Historical narratives are left in their bounded spaces, with Ann Kingsley, the Black plantation mistress, being spoken of mainly in a domestic setting. Zephaniah Kingsley, the planter/enslaver, maintains his omnipotent positionality, being discussed everywhere, while the enslaved are referenced in domestic and labor spaces. What I argue is that, for the sake of cohesion, plantation sites present historical narratives of the enslaved, the plantation mistress, and the planter/enslaver in spaces that do not offer complexity and do not challenge plantation spatial dynamics, but instead orient visitors to the White male planter’s perspective of the past."
2017,Imagining Conformity: Consumption and Homogeneity in the Postwar African American Suburbs,"In the wake of World War II many urbanites left cities for a suburban life that has been persistently derided for its apparent social, material, and class homogeneity. This paper examines the African American experience of post–World War II suburbanization and the attractions of suburban life for African America. The paper examines two suburban projects in Indianapolis, Indiana, one a “sweat equity” housing community and the other a subdivision, both of which placed consumption at the heart of postwar citizenship. Rather than frame such consumption simply in terms of resistance to anti-Black racism, the two suburban experiences illuminate the African American imagination of visual and material “sameness” and demonstrate the challenges of archaeological studies of ethnicity and stylistic distinction."
2017,Race and Agency in the Williamsburg Area’s Free African American Population from 1723 to 1830,"In 1723, Virginia’s slave code created a racial order that placed free African Americans, along with Native Americans, in the “other free” category. As freeborn individuals they were entitled to rights not afforded to enslaved individuals; yet, as “other free,” they were subject to restrictions not placed on European Americans. As a reaction to these restrictions, free African Americans drew on relationships and circumstances to create means for resisting their oppression. Virginia’s 1782 manumission laws opened freedom to those who were not born into it. As an unintended result, enslavers were confronted with an increasingly visible free African American population, which they believed threatened the institution of slavery. Additional laws and emerging public opinion significantly altered the ways in which free African Americans were racialized. In response to these changes, free African Americans formed new relationships and creatively used space and landscape to challenge their place in society."
2017,"Access Denied: African Americans and Access to End-of-Life Care in Nineteenth-Century Washington, D.C.","In 1959, construction workers uncovered skeletal remains associated with two 19th-century African American and Quaker cemeteries in Washington, D.C. Thirty years later, biological anthropologists at the Smithsonian Institution analyzed a small sample of the remains and concluded that “the overall health pattern of this group [from the Mt. Pleasant Plains Cemetery] was one of good health in comparison to other blacks and many whites of the time” (Mann and Krakker 1989:21). However, recognizing the limitation of small sample size for bioarchaeological study (MNI=14), researchers were unable to make general inferences about African American mortality and morbidity in the District of Columbia. Building upon this earlier bioarchaeological analysis, this study uses demographic data from the death records of 7,237 individuals interred at the Mt. Pleasant Plains Cemetery between 1874 and 1890 to infer variability in access to healthcare amongst African Americans in the late 19th century. The results demonstrate that, for African American women, access to end-of-life care (EoLC) in hospitals was in part contingent upon employment. Thus, young African American women less than 16 years of age represent one of the most vulnerable populations in 19th-century Washington, D.C., as they lacked general access to EoLC in hospitals. In addition to exploring this gendered component to healthcare, this study also demonstrates the diverse health experiences of African Americans and argues that archaeologists can adhere to ethical principles that discourage archaeological excavations while still addressing important research questions."
2017,"Writ on the Landscape: Racialization, Whiteness, and River Street","Prior to the civil rights movement, most cities in the United States had at least one racially segregated neighborhood—a place where the Others lived. This was typically a geographic location designated by the White community as the area in which non-Whites could reside. In Boise, Idaho, African Americans and other non-Whites lived in the River Street neighborhood, a multiethnic and multiracial enclave that provided shelter from discrimination. While African Americans comprised only a portion of the neighborhood’s population, it was stigmatized as a Black neighborhood and was segregated from the rest of the town. Oral-history interviews and archival research conducted as part of the River Street Digital History Project revealed the way the neighborhood was remembered by both Black and White residents. As a segregated place on the landscape, the River Street neighborhood provides an opportunity to examine the role structural racial hierarchies played in the creation of Whiteness for Boise’s European American community."
2016,Toward a South Asian Historical Archaeology,"This article briefly reviews historical archaeologies of South Asia. In 1996 Charles Orser argued that historical archaeology needs to consider its own definition more broadly and internationalize its scope (Orser 1996). Such an approach would define the contours of the modern world more concretely. This program of research has been widely adopted, yet it has been hampered, to a certain extent, by its hemispheric focus on the Atlantic World. South Asia, as a key constituent of the Indian Ocean, troubles this approach to historical archaeology and demands consideration of other circulations, epicenters, and agendas in the development of the modern world. This article considers that trade, landscapes, and material culture all point to a modern world in which the Atlantic World is not the only epicenter."
2016,Historical Archaeology and Heritage in the Middle East: A Preliminary Overview,"While not a traditional focus of archaeological research in the region, historical archaeology has a growing presence in the Middle East. Themes explored by colleagues interested in the post-1500 archaeological record include both topics of globalization and colonialism relevant to historical archaeology around the world and topics specific to local cultural and historical postmedieval developments—and sometimes both simultaneously. Such has been the growth in relevant studies in the past two decades that a preliminary overview of historical archaeology from Anatolia to Oman and Cairo to Khorasan can now be offered."
2016,"The Production of Affluence in Central New York: The Archaeology and History of Geneva’s White Springs Manor, 1806–1951","The multicomponent White Springs site (NYSM 1952; RMSC Plp-018) in Geneva, New York, contributes to the archaeological study of historical farm sites and presents an opportunity for the diachronic study of elite maneuvering to maintain affluence. Though a neoclassical-style mansion presently sits on the property as a visible symbol of solidity and stability, documentary and archaeological evidence reveals a varied history with considerable ties to local and regional trends and economies. Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the manor and associated property played differing roles in the economic and social strategies of a string of wealthy owners. Historical records reveal changing practices, from piedmont-style plantation agriculture to orcharding and dairying, as well as varied land-use practices with materially unique manifestations in the archaeological record. Through archaeological excavations, documentary research, surface survey, and archaeogeophysical investigations, this paper takes a multiscalar approach to revealing the diverse adaptive strategies elites used throughout White Springs Manor’s history, encompassing the multi-sited endeavors owners used to generate wealth both at and beyond the manor. These processes are attested to by datable landscape modifications and the changing use of the property over time."
2016,Texas Mission Ceramics: Origins of Manufacture and Distribution during the Eighteenth Century,"Nearly 800 ceramic sherds from 10 Spanish colonial sites in Texas were analyzed using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) as a tool for understanding the local-resource production and distribution of Native American pottery, lead-glazed coarse earthenwares, and tin-glazed wares (majolica). The chemical characteristics of their pastes were compared to identify similarities that might indicate sources of manufacture. Data were also compared to other INAA studies. Combined with accounts of known supply stations and supply routes into Texas, the authors were able to identify three manufacturing locales for Native American pottery and five for lead-glazed wares. Evidence of a period of transition between Native American technologies and European technologies was also inferred."
2016,"The United States–Mexican War Soldiers of Greenwood Island, Mississippi: An Historical, Archaeological, and Bioarchaeological Analysis","The analysis of the remains of six soldiers recovered on the Mississippi Sound represents one of the few bioarchaeological studies of soldiers from the USA-Mexican War (1846–1848), a time of Manifest Destiny coupled with extensive immigration. The soldiers at Camp Jefferson Davis do not represent those who fell during fighting, but, most likely, those who died from dysentery, which was rampant during the war. Overall, results of analysis closely mirrored expectations based on historical records. All were young adult males of European ancestry. They were of average stature and exhibited typical rates of nutritional deficiencies and childhood-growth disruptions for the time. The soldiers showed evidence of robust physical activity, but trauma was relatively rare, with only one possible battlefield injury seen. When the findings are situated in historical context, they provide unique insight into health conditions of both the military and civilian components of American society during the mid-19th century."
2016,"Gunflint Production and Lithic Tool Use at the Monhantic Fort Site, a Mashantucket Pequot Fortified Village (1675–1677)","The Monhantic Fort site is a Mashantucket Pequot fortified village occupied during King Philip’s War (1675–1677). Archaeological investigations resulted in the recovery of over 900 pieces of European flint (English and continental European) derived from ballast cobbles, believed to be primarily associated with the wartime production of gunflints. The majority of the gunflints are bifacial (86%), indicating a process of manufacture distinct from contemporaneous English manufacture. While many lithic tools had been replaced with European metal tools by this time, the flint assemblage also contains a number of objects indicating use of lithic tools in domestic contexts. Spatial analysis of the flint assemblage in the context of domestic and nondomestic spaces indicates individual production of gunflints and tools, rather than specialized production confined to a single workshop area by a limited number of individuals. Comparison of the flint assemblage at Monhantic Fort with a contemporaneous domestic site at Mashantucket and the Aptucxet Trading Post in Bourne, Massachusetts, supports the contention that the fort assemblage was the result of the wartime production of gunflints."
2016,"Marks from the Past, Signs of the Future—the Dikenga of Historical Archaeology","Historical archaeology’s recognition of a mark known as the Bakongo dikenga and found on colonoware pottery, as well as other artifacts, is used to examine the history of this research and suggest its future progression. The dikenga is also used as a metaphor for historical archaeological inquiry. This article explores the intersection between personal experience and scholarly research within the cycle of theories and perspectives that influence archaeological progression and the study of the dikenga."
2016,Recent Directions and Future Developments in Geographic Information Systems for Historical Archaeology,"Geographic information systems (GIS) have become a core tool of archaeology by allowing the rapid comparison of complex datasets and supporting wholly new forms of analysis. This development is not surprising, since archaeology was one of the first disciplines to embrace the new technology as it became more commonplace in the 1980s. The past three decades have seen a proliferation of archaeological GIS studies, with the majority focusing on prehistoric contexts. While early examples of GIS for historical archaeology do exist, serious engagement with the technology did not emerge until the 2000s. The following article provides a much needed overview of the current state of archaeological GIS for historical archaeology. This includes a brief summary of previous and ongoing research to demonstrate the unique possibilities that emerge when historical archaeologists utilize GIS to its fullest potential. This overview groups the use of GIS into three familiar categories of inventory, geospatial analysis, and mapmaking. Building on this overview, the author examines emerging uses of GIS for historical archaeology. These new directions rely on historical archaeology’s unique approach to studying the past, which relies upon the combination of artifacts, documents, and ethnohistory. These emerging forms of practice include counter-mapping, new forms of immersive 3-D GIS, and the possibilities of computer simulation. The article concludes with a frank discussion of the challenges that may hinder these potentials and the possibility for theory building between historical archaeology and other disciplines."
2016,Fifty Years On: History’s Handmaiden? A Plea for Capital H History,"This article considers the discipline of historical archaeology as it reaches its 50-year milestone. A call to integrate history and archaeology more closely and, in particular, to think about methods for exploring interdisciplinarity is proposed. Through the conceptual frameworks of hybridity and bricolage a material approach is discussed and suggestions offered for ways to integrate history and archaeology, and consider “Capital H History.” With an Australian settler/colonial focus, the article ponders the relationships, similarities, and schisms between historical archaeology and indigenous or community archaeology through a discussion of early European contact sites, artifacts, and conceptual categories. It is argued that the study of the past emerges from the intersection between words and things. Here, in the realm of the tangible and intangible, where images, artifacts, and ephemera all provide evidence of the past—a synthesized history is possible."
2016,Categories in Motion: Emerging Perspectives in the Archaeology of Postcolumbian Indigenous Communities,"This essay provides a personal and somewhat polemical assessment of recent developments in the historical archaeology of sites occupied by indigenous groups, and very tentatively predicts future trends. Three conceptual areas—holism, vantage point, and the social practice of archaeology—are identified as zones for future improvement. In terms of holism, greater empirical and analytical attention needs be paid to the full range of interacting parties, including both settler and indigenous interlocutors, in order to better understand processes of mutual influence. Vantage-point analysis can be used to better capture the details of historical settings through attempts to understand the spatial dimensions of power relations and, also, to further the deployment of local indigenous concepts in scholarship. In terms of the social practice of archaeology, trends in authorship and the lack of integration of “dirt” archaeology and decolonizing methods in archaeological writing remain problematic."
2016,Capitalism in Motion,"In this article, we take up Oilman’s (2014) challenge that historical archaeology should explore the motion of capitalism both in space and time. We discuss capitalism as a dynamic totality and use this to develop the implications for historical archaeology in two different but interconnected ways. First, we use the rich context of Lowell, Massachusetts, to provide a detailed analysis of how capitalism developed in a single place. The second case uses several archaeological sites from across the U.S. to highlight capitalism’s motion from the perspective of a single commodity, coal. We link labor and the environment, past and present, to highlight the folly of seeing the exploitation of workers and the environment is as an accepted part of capitalist economic development. Understanding capitalism in motion is more than just a future research direction for historical archaeology because without these critical understandings people may not have a future at all."
2016,Historical Archaeology Outlook: A Latin American Perspective,"This article begins with the history of historical archaeology as an American discipline spreading to the rest of the globe. It then considers that the discipline will develop more and more on peripheral areas, and that an Anglo-Saxon emphasis on capitalism and globalization will be challenged by cultural, even nationalist, subjects and perspectives, as these differences will play a growing role in 21st-century politics and academia. A Latin American approach is then proposed, stressing local issues and cultural specificities and such innovative concepts as transculturation and mixed societies. The archaeology of slavery and rebellion is emphasized. A comparative approach is a fertile strategy with which to explore the different ways Latin America material culture may be used to study exploitation and resistance in a process linked to identity building in different countries. The article then concludes by predicting that, from its origin as a “WASP” discipline, historical archaeology may really become the study of material culture relevant to people worldwide."
2016,"Transatlantic Currents: Exploring the Past, Present, and Future of Global Historical Archaeology","The past, present, and future of global historical archaeology is addressed first through a comparative analysis of the development of the discipline in North America and the British Isles, and second by a consideration of the recent expansion of interest around the world and particularly in postcolonial contexts. Drawing from a range of global case studies, it is argued that the most productive way forward for the discipline lies in its ability to engage productively with contemporary societal problems and global challenges in locally rooted and contingent ways."
2016,"Horizons beyond the Perimeter Wall: Relational Materiality, Institutional Confinement, and the Archaeology of Being Global","As historical archaeologists, how might we begin to unpick the complex material webs of trades, migrations, and technologies that constitute globalization? How should we simultaneously understand the local and transnational meanings of our study sites? Through examples based around the 19th-century transportation of British felons to the Australian penal colonies, this article considers how recent work in relational theory offers fresh directions for exploring how the process of “being global” enmeshes humans, artifacts, and landscapes into ever-wider meshworks of connection and significance. It suggests that by traveling along the dynamic awful lines of globalization from the inside out, we archaeologists can consider not only what alternatives could have been, but what might be in our future."
2016,Archaeology and the Time of Modernity,"In this article an archaeological critique of the time of modernity is proposed. This critique is developed through three main themes: materiality, multi-temporality, and ethics. Materiality is key to producing relevant archaeological accounts of the time of modernity: historical archaeology has to follow the time of things, rather than the temporal frameworks inherited from history and other fields. Multi-temporality is at the heart of modernity, which has to be understood as a heterogeneous phenomenon in which multiple, often incompatible, temporalities coalesce and clash, rather than as an homogeneous time of change and acceleration. Finally, the blurring of the past/present divide that is manifested through universal justice, political temporalities, and indigenous memory practices poses an important challenge to archaeology, but, at the same time, provides a unique opportunity to make the discipline socially relevant."
2016,Archaeologies of Emergent Presents and Futures,"This article traces the genealogy of the subfield that has become known as the “archaeology of the contemporary past” and argues for its more thorough integration with an expanded field of historical archaeology. One of the central challenges for archaeology over the coming decades will be to find a way to engage with emerging, contemporary, sociomaterial phenomena and, hence, with issues of both contemporary and future ecological, social, political, and economic concern. Drawing on the framework for a new internationally collaborative, interdisciplinary research project, Heritage Futures, that seeks to understand the material-discursive processes of heritage and other heritage-like fields as distinctive forms of future-assembling practices through the application of a range of archaeological ethnographic methods, the article concludes that the potential for an expanded field of historical archaeology lies in its ability to engage with emergent futures by way of archaeological ethnographies that are attuned to the sociomaterial aspects of these and other future-assembling practices."
2016,"Cowrie Shells, Global Trade, and Local Exchange: Piecing Together the Evidence for Colonial Virginia","Cowries of the species Monetaria moneta and Monetaria annulus are marine gastropods native to the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Both species served historically as currency in West Africa. Archaeologists have interpreted cowries at North American historical sites as evidence of African or African American identity and spirituality. Economic historians studying colonial economic systems do not consider cowries in North America at all. The temporal and spatial distribution of these shells in Virginia suggests that their use in the 18th-century colony merits critical examination. Cowries were concentrated in colonial ports that served the transatlantic slave trade. Shells may have been used subsequently in the colony as currency in an economy characterized by a chronic shortage of coin. A regional analytical scale reveals a more complex picture of the temporal, spatial, and social distribution of cowries than has been understood to date, underscoring the roles that cowries played in local and regional responses to colonialism."
2016,Colonial Housing Reform and Transitions in Architecture in the Bella Coola Area of British Columbia,"The Northwest Coast’s iconic, multifamily, cedar-planked houses persisted in the Bella Coola area of British Columbia into the 20th century, despite the pressures of Indian agents and missionaries to adopt small, nuclear-family, frame houses. This may seem to be a simple example of conservatism and resistance to programs of acculturation, but such a view leaves unaddressed questions about why resistance occurs and how it is negotiated. Here it is argued that the underlying reasons were fundamental disconformities between European Canadian house forms and the riverine environment of the area, as well as an inability of the new house style to fulfill the multitude of deeply articulated social, economic, and ideological functions of the planked houses. Identifying these disconformities allows a consideration of how they were actively accommodated and negotiated, rather than simply viewing the encounter over housing to be one of resistance followed by loss."
2016,"From Colonial Representation to Materiality: Spanish Settlements on the Valdés Peninsula, Patagonian Coast (1779–1810)","In recent years the acknowledgment of the importance of peripheral realities, local contexts, and social actors’ roles in shaping both colonialism and modern society has contributed toward challenging the conception of colonialism as a monolithic, unilinear process. This article explores this problematic through the historical and archaeological study of the Spanish colonization of Patagonia. It describes the case of Fuerte San José (Valdés Peninsula, Chubut Province, Argentina), a military fort that existed between 1779 and 1810 and is discussed as an example of the way colonization actually operated within a wider colonial context. There, the integration of historical and archaeological evidence provides the means for contrasting the planning and the implementation of colonial projects in order to uncover their complex and multifaceted character."
2016,Bristol-Glazed Stoneware on Rural Indiana Farms: Effects of Technology Adoption on Consumer Choice,"White Bristol slip-glazed utilitarian stoneware occurs on many 19th-century sites in the United States. British and American potteries produced Bristol-glazed pottery, but at different times and in different forms. American potters used Bristol slip glaze after the 1880s, about 50 years after the British developed it. A behavioral approach to technology adoption uses the performance characteristics of stoneware glazes to identify the economic and perceptual characteristics that made Bristol glaze attractive to industrialized potteries then and not earlier. Historical documents clarify the rate and locations of adoptions. Documents also suggest that consumers may have played a role in choosing the white Bristol over the brown Albany-type slip glazes, although both had similar economic benefits. A set of rural Indiana sites shows how the production histories of salt, Albany, and Bristol glaze affected the range of possible consumer-choice and glaze-type representations in archaeological assemblages."
2016,The Significance of Hotel-Ware Ceramics in the Twentieth Century,"Hotel ware is a durable, vitrified, ceramic tableware introduced to North America in the late 19th century. The ware became very popular in the first half of the 20th century, with production peaking in the late 1920s and again in the late 1940s. Hotel ware was prized for its toughness and cost-effectiveness, and was the ware of choice in nearly every commercial and institutional setting of that period. Ceramics recovered from trash middens at the site of Riding Mountain Prison Camp, an institution in Canada that held German soldiers during the Second World War, inform a brief case study that shows that hotel ware was employed in the institution to maximize economic efficiency, to simplify provisioning for a large group of imprisoned men, and to contribute to sanitation and healthfulness."
2016,Small Arms and Munitions from a Texas Coastal Shipwreck,"In February 1998, the National Underwater Maritime Agency discovered a shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico, located in the historic pass to Matagorda Bay, Texas. It was initially believed the wreck might be the French supply vessel L’Aimable that sank in 1685 and was part of LaSalle’s expedition to the Texas coast. Subsequent investigation of the site by the Texas Historical Commission discovered the vessel likely dated to the late 18th or early 19th centuries. The small collection of artifacts recovered were comprised of British and Spanish military arms, copper sheathing, rigging elements, assorted munitions, and other materials. Artifact analysis and research indicates the shipwreck dates to the early 19th century and may be associated with privateering and/or naval activities that played a part in the territorial and political changes around the Gulf of Mexico during this time."
2016,Dynamic Landscapes: The Emergence of Formal Spaces in Colonial Virginia,"Archaeologists studying the domestic landscapes that took shape in the Chesapeake region from the 1670s to 1730 typically conclude that these early settlements were the product of frontier environments, where functional utility dominated and aesthetic design had little value for all but the very wealthiest members of society. Reevaluation of two early Virginia plantations, Newman’s Neck and the Clifts, suggests that the relationships between colonists and their domestic places bears further examination, and that, among lesser gentry, intentional design in early colonial landscapes is, in fact, evident. Analysis of this design can shed light on the changing dynamics of power relations within the family, the social relations of labor, and the ways that colonists reinterpreted changing aesthetics within the Atlantic World."
2016,“As It Was Originally Laid Out by the General”: George Washington and His Upper Garden,"The upper garden was a prominent feature of Mount Vernon’s 18th-century landscape, and it remains an important part of the visitor experience today. This walled garden, with its geometric and well-ordered appearance, provides a counterpoint to the naturalistic, albeit carefully designed, landscape that encompasses George Washington’s home. Over time, successive generations reflected their idealized George Washington within the increasingly romanticized upper garden. This article combines the archaeological record with visitor accounts to trace the evolution of the upper garden and explore how images of Washington have been reflected upon this space."
2016,The Multiple Landscapes of Thomas Jefferson’s Poplar Forest,"The ongoing archaeological research into the historic landscapes of Poplar Forest strives to develop a comprehensive understanding of the human interactions that shaped the ornamental grounds, plantation, and natural environment in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This article will explore the results of three projects that have offered valuable perspectives on how these related landscapes intersect at Thomas Jefferson’s retreat and plantation in Bedford County, Virginia. The environmental and material culture analyses associated with the retreat’s ornamental plant nursery, double row of paper mulberry trees, and north tree clumps and oval flowerbeds demonstrate ties to the environmental transformations brought about by Jefferson’s vision for the property."
2016,Urbanization and Landscape Change in Early-Eighteenth-Century Boston: The Environmental Archaeology of Town Dock,"The creation of the urban built landscape is perhaps one of the most dramatic examples of anthropogenic environmental change. This paper explores the creation of the urban landscape in downtown Boston during the early 18th century. Archaeological excavations next to Faneuil Hall, Boston’s iconic market building, recovered evidence for land-making processes and the filling of Town Dock. The macrobotanicals, pollen, faunal remains, and insects in the landfill reveal, at very different scales, the changing nature of the urban environment from the area immediately around the site to the broader region. A study of these data in the context of the filling of Town Dock thus provides a detailed view of human actions in the creation and structuring of the urban landscape."
2016,"Meeting at Market: The Intersection of African American Culture, Craft, and Economy and the Landscape of Charleston, South Carolina","Markets were integral to the development of Charleston’s urban landscape, and the interaction between African Americans and market spaces shaped Charleston. The archaeology of the South Carolina low country highlights African Americans’ role in Charleston’s market economy and the significance of this economy in forging an African American cultural identity, the Gullah. The linkage between markets and African American space in Charleston persists, and these connections indicate that markets and the market economy have deep-seated meanings to the Gullah."
2016,Plowing Prairies and Raising Stock: Historical Ecology and Community Life on the Cotton Frontier of Southwest Arkansas,"The first half of the 19th century was a time of great change across the American landscape. In Arkansas, social, economic, and environmental transformations occurred as free and enslaved settlers established new ways of life along the southwestern edge of the United States during the decades following the Louisiana Purchase. By introducing an approach that draws from historical ecology and practice theory, this article applies interdisciplinary methods to explore the antebellum community of Ozan Township, which grew around the town of Washington, Arkansas. Diverse sources shed light on dynamic relationships between people and their environment that have existed within this compelling portion of the South’s cotton frontier."
2016,"Intersecting Landscapes: A Palynological Study of Pueblo, Spanish, and Anglo-American Land Use in New Mexico","The southwestern United States provides an opportunity to study the environmental impacts of culturally diverse peoples within a single geographic region. Using palynological data from a 600-year period, we examine the effects of differing land-use strategies employed by Pueblos, Spanish colonists, and Anglo-Americans around the village of La Cienega, New Mexico. The data indicate that, prior to Spanish colonization, Puebloan peoples had successful agricultural practices that created a diverse anthropogenic landscape. Successive waves of Spanish colonists, beginning in the 16th century, and Anglo-American colonists, in the 19th century, brought new plants, animals, and agricultural technologies that interacted with existing indigenous strategies. This history of the landscape of the Southwest reveals the subtle reorganization of the anthropogenic landscape resulting from the interaction and persistence of these three cultural traditions."
2016,The Archaeology of Underground Mining Landscapes,"The mining industry is known for leaving dramatic landscapes in its wake, and among these are the workings hidden below the surface. As dangerous places, underground mines exerted important holds over community life and shaped the formation of mining identities. Despite this centrality to the mining life, historical archaeological research underground remains limited because the hazards have never dissipated. This article establishes prospective ground for the archaeology of underground mines, taking its lead from several pioneering studies in order to better assess the nature of recoverable archaeological information. In particular, it is argued that the material evidence from the workplace enables localized insights into scalar transformations occurring in the industry, the cultures of work practice, and the mechanisms by which miners coped with uncertain environments. This article also considers strategies by which future investigations might safely proceed."
2016,Landscapes of Japanese American Internment,"The archaeology of Japanese and Japanese American internment has burgeoned in recent years, in large part developing out of research conducted by the National Park Service, and, to a more limited extent, cultural resource management firms and archaeologists working within the context of academia. This article places these previously conducted research projects in dialogue by looking at the challenges inherent in studying both demographically large and small internment camps. In particular, it focuses on the challenge of reconstructing context and provenience information, as well as consumption and depositional practices within internment camps."
2016,The Practice and Theory of New Heritage for Historical Archaeology,"New heritage refers to the intersection of new media technologies and traditional heritage studies. This includes the use of digital technologies to virtually reconstruct archaeological objects and contexts. This article presents readers with an overview of these approaches through two case studies drawn from African American archaeology. The first case study explores the reconstruction of Kingsley Plantation, near Jacksonville, Florida. This study uses SketchUp and Google Earth to create and share the site. The second case study examines a similar project in Rosewood, Florida, that combines a wider range of data, while exploring a mixed methods approach to sharing the virtual reconstruction. The authors also examine the ways such work intersects with historical archaeological studies of African American identity and landscape."
2015,"Late-Nineteenth-Century Foodways in the “Garden State” at the Woodruff House, Rahway, New Jersey: Insights from Small Faunal and Large Macrobotanical Samples","Excavations of a late-19th-century property in Rahway, New Jersey, recovered a rich privy deposit related to the prominent Woodruff family. Food remains in the privy include a small amount of faunal material and a very large macrobotanical collection that stand as a benchmark providing insights into the food consumption of the affluent and the development of New Jersey’s identity as the “Garden States.”"
2015,Tea and Ethnicity in Southeastern Pennsylvania: A Transatlantic Perspective on German American Consumption,"German Americans expanded their communities in British colonial America by successfully negotiating transatlantic networks, yet most archaeological and material culture studies of this group privilege isolating folk culture and local production over transatlantic engagement. Imported consumer goods, including tea and coffee wares, are also part of German American assemblages, but they are often interpreted through British frameworks. By reframing the consumption of imported goods as a means of facilitating immigration and maintaining personal relationships abroad, I argue for an understanding of consumer goods that extends beyond fashion, status, and style to address the community-building networks these goods created. Exploring German engagement with these goods on both sides of the Atlantic challenges the understanding of immigrant experiences and material culture in early America, revealing ethnic motivations for consumption in southeastern Pennsylvania and reasons for variation in consumer behavior over time and throughout regions of German settlement."
2015,"Exploring Dietary Variability in a War of 1812 Skeletal Collection from Stoney Creek, Ontario, Using Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopes","The stable isotope composition of human bones was analyzed to investigate the diet of 19th-century soldiers who died during the Battle of Stoney Creek, Ontario, on 6 June 1813. Eighteen bones were selected from the skeletal remains recovered from the Smith’s Knoll Monument to identify the diets of these soldiers in the years prior to their deaths on the battlefield. The carbon and nitrogen isotopic data suggest a high degree of dietary variability within the Smith’s Knoll sample. The δ13C and δ15N values obtained from bone collagen and δ13C values from bone carbonate indicate that, throughout both their civilian and military lives, the Smith’s Knoll soldiers consumed carbohydrates (e.g., wheat and maize) with protein derived primarily from terrestrial sources in the form of domestic livestock. Our results suggest that most of these individuals consumed staple foods characteristic of diets in 19th-century North America and the United Kingdom, with a small number of individuals (n=2) supplementing its diet with freshwater fish."
2015,“To Excite the Devotion of the Catholics”: The Use and Meaning of Catholic Religious Medals in the Colonial Period,"Catholic devotional medals are a significant and persistent find on colonial sites. The traditional explanation for their rapid adoption and spread is based on the religious conflicts of the Low Countries. A broader view is here presented that ties them to a confluence of three significant trends in European history: the Counter-Reformation, the development of technology, and the beginnings of consumerism. An analysis of a large sample of medals, primarily from dated archaeological contexts, that details changes in the size, shape, and content of medals from the 16th through the 18th centuries is presented. Finally, a unique group of medals from 17th-century Maryland is presented to demonstrate how iconography can be be analyzed to provide a cultural context for the use of devotional medals."
2015,Why Quality Mattered: A Case Study Using Ceramics from the French West Indian Colony of Guadeloupe,"Quality, as well as other important factors, such as the prices of goods, influenced the consumption patterns of early modern consumers,. The concept of quality can be useful to archaeologists who study material culture and desire a closer understanding of the consumers’ experience. This article presents an analysis of ceramic quality during the 18th century in Guadeloupe, a French colony in the West Indies. The data come from four colonial sites excavated in Basse-Terre, the historic capital, and from probate inventories. The attributes of ceramics that are related to their quality are examined in detail. These include their origin, their value from appraisals in the inventories, and some details about their decoration or style. Analyzing these attributes and comparing the data from the inventories with the archaeological collections yields insights into the importance of quality in Guadeloupe and how quality was defined by local consumers, with a particular focus on the creole elite. The results also suggest that understanding the ways social actors defined quality in the past can enhance artifact classification and archaeological analyses."
2015,“Sometimes They Bury the Deceased’s Clothes and Trinkets”: Indigenous Mortuary Practices at Mission Santa Clara de Asís,"Mission Santa Clara de Asís, a Franciscan mission in Alta California, was home to Ohlone/Costanoan, Yokuts, and Miwok people who perpetuated and reinterpreted mortuary practices at multiple points across the landscape. More than three decades of archaeological research at Mission Santa Clara has revealed burials and associated grave goods from two different mission era cemeteries, as well as the archaeological remains of possible mourning ceremonies within the mission’s indigenous residential area. Burial records also reveal a wealth of information about how Franciscans and native people negotiated cultural and religious practices regarding death and mourning. The findings from Santa Clara are contextualized through evidence from precontact archaeological sites and early ethnographies, as well as from historical accounts by missionaries and other observers. The processes of negotiation and accommodation that unfolded between Franciscan missionaries and indigenous people at Mission Santa Clara are compared with evidence from other Alta California missions."
2015,Placing the North,"The northern world was created through contingent social and material relations that can be traced to the history of European and Western expansion. Scientific modes of representation, coupled with new systems of circulation and new appetites for mass consumption, served to create a stable, if flexible, image of the north in regions to the south. These sets of southern-centric views and their material consequences have had variable impacts on people living in “the North” and have resulted in a mixed legacy. As historical and contemporary archaeologies are well placed to examine the material relations that helped to create, as well as contest, modern incursions, the aim of this issue is to explore these themes and to inspire future contributions."
2015,I Wish I Was Where I Was When I Was Wishing I Was Here: Mentalities and Materialities in Contemporary and Historical Iceland,"The north acts as an Other space; somewhere that lies beyond. It is also a real place, however. In this article, I tease out the parameters that Iceland’s landscape offers for an understanding of the tensions between virtual north and real north. The first part of the article discusses the context of 19th-century antiquarian adventuring to Iceland. Foreign visitors journeyed to Iceland to reconnect with a past that was being lost in the industrializing landscapes of Western Europe. The second part of the article focuses on present-day archaeological surveys of a group of islands in Breiðafjörður, West Iceland. Drawing on a phenomenological approach and a discussion of 19th-century visits to Iceland by travelers, such as William Morris and W. G. Collingwood, the article explores how sagas and other local histories influence the production of archaeological knowledge and placemaking."
2015,"The Changing Lives of Women’s Knives: Ulus, Travel, and Transformation","As the biographies of objects reflect the practices, values, and connections of the people who own and exchange them, the circulation of material culture across and between societies can demonstrate how people navigate cultural contact. In the 19th-century North American Arctic, ulus were not only utilitarian tools that entered transcontinental trading networks, they were signs from which indigenous people in whaling villages and nonnative sailors, explorers, and collectors drew impressions of each other. By the late 20th century, ulus in collections from the eastern United States had come to reflect the historical connections among Inuit, Inupiat, and American social worlds."
2015,"Confronting Marginality in the North Atlantic: Archaeological and Historical Perspectives from the French Colony of Plaisance, Newfoundland","The French colony at Plaisance, Newfoundland, Canada—occupied from 1662 to 1714—was France’s only official colony in Newfoundland. It was a fishing settlement in which colonists caught, processed, and exported dried codfish to various European ports. Despite being the largest French settlement in Newfoundland, Plaisance (known to the English as Placentia) has typically been regarded as a peripheral and insignificant outpost in the northern region of French North America. In this historiographical tradition, the colony suffers in its remote, inhospitable environment, which contributed to the impoverishment of its residents and rendered them utterly dependent on overseas trade for their survival. Detailed analysis of a previously unstudied archival series reveals that this standard narrative exaggerates the situation. The Vieux Fort site (dating from 1662 to 1690) provides a well-preserved archaeological context with which the standard historiography of the colony can be confronted. Economic, social, and environmental marginality are relative concepts, and perceptions of Plaisance’s marginal status differ, depending on the interpreter and the interpretation."
2015,"Time, Seasonality, and Trade: Swedish/Finnish-Sámi Interactions in Early Modern Lapland","Recent theoretical debates have identified time as a key area for research by historical archaeologists. In this paper we present evidence from Tornio, in northern Finland, and suggest that the early-17th-century colonists who founded this town developed a multidimensional conception of time that varied according to context and allowed deeply held folk beliefs to coexist alongside Lutheran doctrines and also facilitated seasonal trade with the indigenous Sami people in the upper reaches of Lapland."
2015,North/South Encounters at Sámi Sacred Sites in Northern Finland,"This article focuses on the use of Sámi sacrificial places called sieidi (in North Sámi). Their meanings to the Sámi people changed when the indigenous northern tradition collided with the colonial expansion of Christian culture from the south. Sieidi sites have had a long period of use—from the turn of the first millennium A.D. until the 18th century—in some cases up to the present day. During this time, the influence of the church and agrarian society in the north has increased. Consequently, attitudes toward sieidi and their associated meanings vary widely: some people wish to destroy the “pagan” sites or view them as scientific curiosities, while others use them, alongside Christian churches, as places to practice indigenous beliefs. Sámi attitudes toward the sacrificial sites of their ethnic religion have been in constant dialog with colonial and subsequent neocolonial contacts emanating from the south."
2015,Memorials and Marching: Archaeological Insights into Segregation in Contemporary Northern Ireland,"Since the Belfast Agreement was signed in 1998, marking the official end of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, analysis has mainly focused on compromising politicians and the moves towards normalization. Whilst high-level political resolutions are significant, this article argues that there is a need to explore how the more mundane but insidious materializations of societal abnormality have been ignored by politicians, but are meaningful in understanding the post-conflict context. The continuing material presences of segregation in working-class communities, which commonly take the form of ethnic enclaves divided by abandoned interfaces and monumental walls, reveals a longstanding lack of engagement with this repercussion of the Troubles. Of particular interest are evolving commemorative and memorialization practices in Nationalist and Loyalist communities that demonstrate the impact of physical segregation on sustaining singular understandings of the recent past."
2015,Northern Worldviews in Postmedieval Orkney: Toward a More Holistic Approach to Later Landscapes,"This article proposes a new theoretical approach to understanding postmedieval landscapes in Orkney, Scotland. Although this period has received considerable attention from economic and political historians and from ethnologists, these approaches have not adequately represented the worldviews and cosmologies of local historical communities. A more holistic approach must be employed, emphasizing the unique northern-ness of Orkney in terms of its Norse legacy, folklore and multiperiod remains. Folk beliefs, specifically those associated with prehistoric mounds, provide an example of how complex dialectical relationships between people and the world around them, past and present, are manifested. Tasks capes of the seasonal round and the expansion of the hill dikes are examples used to examine the interconnection between communities and significant places in the landscape. In addition, Norse phenomena, such as Udal law (Norse law) and the Scandinavian concept of utmark, provide new analogies for landscape interactions within this context. A case study at Quandale, on the island of Rousay, is used to discuss these themes, allowing the re conceptualization of a more richly textured historical world in a northern context."
2015,Chronology and Use of Guatemalan Maiolica: Ceramics as Reducción in the Izalcos Region of El Salvador,"Maiolica (tin-enameled earthenware) was a staple of daily life for serving food and drink, as well as other household purposes, in Spain and Spanish America throughout the colonial period. Examining choices in ceramic styles is one way to examine the colonial policies of reducción, which were to instill a regular, commonplace Christian order in everyday life. The Río Ceniza Valley of western El Salvador, the heartland of the Nahua-speaking Pipil polity known as the Izalcos, was a center of Spanish colonial commerce in Guatemala. This research presents a typology and chronology of Guatemalan maiolica, the stylistic similarities of its maiolica types to trends in Europe, and frequencies in rural vs. urban use, based on an ample collection of 16th- to 19th-century Guatemalan maiolica from extensive survey and excavations. The relative importance of maiolica vs. maiolica attributes on indigenous-made pottery gives a view into daily life under extreme conditions of colonialism and the process of reducción."
2015,"Surveying, Statistics, and Spatial Mapping: KOCOA Landscape Analysis of Eighteenth-Century Artillery Placements at Monmouth Battlefield State Park, New Jersey","Monmouth Battlefield State Park in New Jersey has seen 20-plus years of archaeological study. It was the site of the largest and longest land-artillery duel of the Revolutionary War. The authors have chosen to examine the duel from a surveyor’s perspective. During the decades of recovering artifacts, technology has continued to grow and change, and, as a result, new opportunities for historical interpretation have arisen. The authors have combined modern surveying techniques and technology with statistical analysis in order to generate a KOCOA model for locating artillery emplacements and/or intended targets, based on the impact patterns of excavated antipersonnel ordnance. One of the most fascinating results of the study is what appears to be the fields or “cones” of fire generated by the piece-plotting of fragmentary ordnance recovered on the battlefield using geographic information system (GIS) maps. This technique assumes a gun location and generates the cone from that point. This article will examine the patterning of recovered artillery ordnance from the American Revolutionary War Battle of Monmouth to see whether a more accurate model of where the cannons actually stood could be created using surveying, statistics, and spatial mapping. Using this technique and the authors’ working knowledge of 18th-century artillery, the ordnance locational data is first used to establish an artillery line position. The second part of the article will attempt to identify the direction of fire into a target area where the approximate location of the cannon is known."
2015,A Horse-Travel Approach to Landscape Archaeology,"Archaeological studies of movement between communities that had horses should use empirical evidence about horse travel over terrain types analogous to those traversed between historical archaeological sites. The experiences of equestrians are of interest to archaeologists because they reflect past processes of creating landscapes of warfare, communication, transportation, and trade. Late Spanish colonial New Mexico provides an example of how the potential of an equine perspective on landscape-scale choices might change archaeological interpretations of place and space. This article introduces an experimental approach and calls for modeling that accounts for different kinds of observed horse travel that can better articulate archaeological landscape studies with more realistic travel factors encountered by those who populated a dynamic and horse-connected frontier. Datasets generated by such a method will be well-positioned to aid in the interpretation of lived experiences on indigenous landscapes completely transformed by the colonial introduction of the horse."
2015,Dwelling in Space through Knowledge of Place: Building on Epistemological Understandings of the Seventeenth-Century British Atlantic,"This paper explores colonial English epistemologies of weather and climate through an analysis of the dwelling spaces of the 17th-century Chesapeake region. Using Ingold’s notion of the “weather-world,” I consider early modern perceptions of air, temperature, and the body in order to address the various ways in which colonial landscapes were defined and shaped. Employing an analytical method known as buildings information modeling (BIM), I investigate the implications of 17th-century pit-house construction in an attempt to understand the ways in which individuals engage with an environment, constructing and dwelling through a particular way of knowing the world. This analysis ultimately demonstrates how archaeological evidence speaks to the material ways in which people manipulate their experience of place, not only to experience their surroundings, but to shape them to fit the epistemological context that creates a knowledge of place."
2015,Subsistence Practices and Feasting Rites: Chumash Identity after European Colonization,"The Chumash Indians of southern California were active social agents after European contact, making choices in the traditions that they maintained despite drastic transformations in their daily lives. Archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence suggests that they continued to hold large ceremonial feasts with massive quantities of traditional foods prepared in oversized vessels, such as decorated mortars and steatite cooking pots. Many of these vessels proliferated or became more elaborate after the introduction of metal tools. The persistence and elaboration of traditional patterns of food procurement, preparation, and consumption served as a symbol of cultural identity among the Chumash and a means of maintaining and expanding social networks that extended over a wide region of California."
2015,"Fragments of the Past: Archaeology, History, and the Chinese Railroad Workers of North America","Although the labor of the Chinese workers who built the first transcontinental railroad (and other railroads in the western part of the country) was pivotal to the development of the United States, these workers have never received the scholarly attention they deserve. The incredibly rich work of archaeologists who have studied the thousands of pieces of material culture gathered along western rail lines promises to open vibrant new dimensions of historical recovery of this key chapter in the intertwined social, economic, and political histories of China and the United States."
2015,The Historical Experience of Labor: Archaeological Contributions to Interdisciplinary Research on Chinese Railroad Workers,"Since the 1960s, archaeologists have studied the work camps of Chinese immigrant and Chinese American laborers who built the railroads of the American West. The artifacts, sites, and landscapes provide a rich source of empirical information about the historical experiences of Chinese railroad workers. Especially in light of the rarity of documents authored by the workers themselves, archaeology can provide direct evidence of habitation, culinary practices, health care, social relations, and economic networks. As archaeologists expand collaboration with each other and with scholars in other fields, interpretations of archaeological research move beyond site-specific description into analyses that trace the changing experiences of workers as they entered new environments and new landscapes. The materiality of daily life at railroad work camps is interconnected with the risks the workers endured and the wealth that their labor generated for railroad owners and investors."
2015,Celestial Sojourners in the High Sierras: The Ethno-Archaeology of Chinese Railroad Workers (1865–1868),"This exact paper with 30 slide illustrations was presented originally at the 1969 meeting of the Society for Historical Archaeology (SHA) and led to the formation of the SHA’s Overseas Chinese Research Group. It is useful for measuring paradigmatic shifts in the field. The presentation summarized the then-known ethnographic descriptions of Chinese railroad workers, described the archaeological materials found at their work camps at Donner Pass nearly 50 years ago, and proposed that these cultural materials represented an archaeological “horizon style, ” one indicative of the immigration of Chinese laborers worldwide, with their initial arrivals in many countries dating between 1850 and 1870."
2015,The View from Summit Camp,"Chinese laborers occupied Summit Camp in California from 1865 to 1869 while they excavated the tunnels, built the grade, and laid the track over the most daunting obstacle facing the construction of the transcontinental railroad. Several archaeologically driven and tourist-related artifact collecting activities have occurred at Summit Camp, but it still contains important archaeological information. Study of this camp expands the typical historical view of Chinese laborers as subsidiary players in railroad construction. During their stay here, they made Summit Camp their own, building a small town that included many aspects of traditional Chinese culture. The laborers transformed the land that they built and lived in. Patterns of camp organization and layout reflect issues of labor relations and highlight their adaptive skills. The site of Summit Camp retains a remarkable power of place. Its location and landscape convey a sense of the history, resiliency, and labor contribution of Chinese railroad workers."
2015,Moral Discourse and Personhood in Overseas Chinese Contexts,"Resistance and agency have been important themes in archaeological sites of labor. But how should archaeologists address archaeological contexts where resistance seems attenuated? This article takes the construction of the transcontinental railroad (1865–1869) as a case study to explore this question, focusing on the High Sierras section of the railroad around Tahoe National Forest. Chinese laborers in the mid-19th century were oriented toward and empowered by a moral discourse quite different from that of their Western capitalist employers, and these moral differences were intimately connected with divergent understandings of personhood. While Western capitalists understood labor relations through the dominant discourse of possessive individualism and the spirit of capitalism, Chinese workers were invested in a discourse of relational personhood and filiality. Understanding these differences can transform archaeological interpretation of Chinese work camps in regard to the presence of agency and the significance of labor."
2015,"Interpreting Chinese Worker Camps on the Transcontinental Railroad at Promontory Summit, Utah","The first transcontinental railroad was completed at Promontory Summit, Utah, on 10 May 1869. Unique to this construction was the employment of thousands of ethnic Chinese railroad workers. The Promontory Mountains portion of the route had the largest concentration of railroad construction camps. Of 19 camps recorded during an inventory of the Golden Spike National Historic Site, four appear to be of Chinese ethnic origin. These camps were smaller than European American camps, with fewer features. Both Chinese and European American artifacts were found at Chinese worker camps, revealing the practicality of and need for locally produced and railroad-issued items, as well as the workers’ desire to use ethnically familiar items. A comparison with Chinese construction camps in Nevada and California reveals important similarities, suggesting that up to 500 Chinese construction laborers may have lived at the four Utah sites. A multifaceted explanation is provided for the separation of Chinese camps from other workers’ camps."
2015,An Archaeological Strategy for Chinese Workers’ Camps in the West: Method and Case Study,"Railroad work camps associated with Chinese laborers were often occupied for very short periods of time, leaving temporally discrete but shallow deposits of material and ephemeral features for archaeologists to explore. One methodological approach that has proved effective focuses on exposing and investigating the horizontal deposits across the sites, as opposed to more traditional vertical excavations. The use of broad areal exposure and documentation can lead to detailed spatial and functional analyses of material and features. Using a work camp associated with the Virginia & Truckee Railroad as a case study, the authors argue the validity of this approach for subsequent work on railroad-related work camps occupied by Chinese laborers in the 19th and early 20th centuries."
2015,Alliance Strategies in the Racialized Railroad Economies of the American West,"The rural railroad community of Mono Mills, California (1880–1917), was home to individuals of Chinese, Paiute, and European ancestry seeking work in the midst of the economic downturn of the West’s mining region. Archaeology of the workers’ households and archival evidence for the business ventures associated with their livelihoods, such as the Virginia & Truckee Railroad and the Bodie & Benton Railroad & Lumber Company, suggest that, particularly for the Chinese workers, aggregated transience and racism was a major factor in their daily lives and choices. The findings explore multiple ways in which racism biased job opportunities for Chinese laborers while it increased alliance building among marginalized groups—including intercommunity sociality, regional networks for employment, and economic cohesion—and perhaps led to increased fidelity between labor crews and powerful capitalists of the West. These dynamics had long-term impacts on the local, regional, and national socioeconomic networks in which the Chinese laborers participated."
2015,Inscribed in Stone: Historic Inscriptions and the Cultural Heritage of Railroad Workers,"Historic inscriptions accompany rock art panels and sandstone cliffs throughout Montana and the North American plains. The two historic inscription locations described here emphasize the cultural and historical value of these provocative archaeological signatures. One of these includes a cliff face incised with Chinese characters near the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, & Pacific Railroad in southeastern Montana. The Chinese characters are among other historic inscriptions associated with a coal mining district established by that railroad to supply the fuel for its engines, underscoring the inherent connections between extractive industries and railroad rights-of-way. The second location includes a collection of Japanese words and names, as well as Irish and Norwegian names, incised into a sandstone cliff face adjacent to a section of the Northern Pacific Railroad. These inscribed archaeological sites represent text-aided resources that may be some of the only written accounts available to better understand the lives and identities of people in transnational work camps of railroads and associated extractive industries in the American West."
2015,Asian Coins Recovered from Chinese Railroad Labor Camps: Evidence of Cultural Practices and Transnational Exchange,"Asian coins carried and lost by Chinese workers as they lived and worked in camps along the route of the Northern Pacific Railroad can illuminate daily activities, beliefs, and the movement of people and supplies along the rail lines during their construction. A review of what is known about recovered Asian coins in Chinese work camps is compared with recently recovered examples. The role of material recovered by surface collection and the conclusions made possible with them are discussed."
2015,"Zooarchaeology, Localization, and Chinese Railroad Workers in North America","Analysis of zooarchaeological data from sites related to 19thcentury Chinese railroad workers in the United States illustrates the variety of food choices made by these individuals and the effects of “localization” on their food practices. Due to the mobility inherent in the lives of railroad workers, data from railroad line camps and urban and rural Chinatown communities provide a fuller picture of the suite of contexts in which railroad workers made food choices. The resulting data demonstrate that, as Chinese railroad workers moved from context to context, they were able to act upon their culinary beliefs in different ways; they typically enjoyed a wide array of food options and possibilities in larger urban Chinatown communities while creatively managing local conditions to maintain some semblance of Chinese foodways, even in rural environments."
2015,Exploring Health-Care Practices of Chinese Railroad Workers in North America,"Chinese laborers on the North American transcontinental railroads performed dangerous and labor-intensive work, and many died or were seriously injured as a result of explosions, cave-ins, and severe and unpredictable weather. These workers received meager wages and may have faced additional health risks from ethnic violence and malnutrition. Little is known about how these individuals treated their injuries and ailments and, to date, not a single document written by a Chinese railroad worker has been discovered. Analysis of medicinal artifacts, dating from 1865 to 1910, recovered from railroad sites in California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Texas, and Utah, combined with research on existing documentary and archaeological sources on Chinese medicine in 19th-century North America, provide a better understanding of the healthcare practices employed by Chinese railroad workers. Lacking access to traditional doctors and herbal stores, workers relied on a system of informal “folk” medicine that involved using both European American and Chinese medicines."
2015,Rails Built of the Ancestors’ Bones: The Bioarchaeology of the Overseas Chinese Experience,"Between 1865 and 1869, thousands of Chinese immigrants came to the United States to construct the transcontinental railroad. Their impact went beyond labor and helped to develop the social and economic landscape of the country through their ingenuity. Archaeological analyses are especially important for understanding the Chinese in historical America because of the lack of written records. Bioarchaeology can contribute by providing a glimpse into the lives of these resourceful and diverse laborers who toiled to contribute to the development of the railways in the 19th century. The reanalysis of the remains of 13 Chinese men recovered from a cemetery in Carlin, Nevada, reveals that most individuals exhibited widespread musculoskeletal development suggesting frequent, repeated bodily strain. Additionally, all 13 individuals exhibited skeletal trauma or pathologies. The men recovered from Carlin reveal the extent to which Chinese railroad workers endured exploitative oppression and racism, while simultaneously embodying resilience."
2015,Commentary on the Archaeology of Chinese Railroad Workers in North America: Where Do We Go from Here?,"Archaeologists have spent nearly five decades excavating sites associated with Chinese immigrants to the American West. They have studied hundreds of places and millions of artifacts and compiled enormous amounts of information. It is time for synthesis; it is time for sharing beyond the narrow archaeological community. The material is too rich, too important, to bury in technical reports and obscure jargon. It can connect contemporary American and Chinese communities in a common quest for an understanding of the past in the interests of the future."
2015,Forgotten Chinese Railroad Workers Remembered: Closing Commentary by an Historian,"In the concluding essay for this volume, Sue Fawn Chung (Zhang Sufang) briefly traces the development of historical and archaeological research in Chinese American studies that shows the new direction of multidisciplinary approach and multiethnic considerations. She has highlighted the contributions of the authors in this journal issue."
2014,Modeling Gender: A Carolina Perspective,"It is proving difficult to tie gender theory and gender studies to historical archaeological evidence: documents, primary and secondary deposits, artifact scatters, and data from whole or truncated features To clarify the application of gender theory to historical archaeological investigations, a systematic connection between material culture data, methods, and theory must be formulated A sample matrix is offered to illustrate possible pathways between specific strands of gender research and material culture studies This discussion of gender approaches, diverse methods, and corresponding material culture draws, in part, on North Carolina examples."
2014,Frontier Arms Race: Historical and Archaeological Analysis of an Assemblage of Eighteenth-Century Cannon Recovered from the Detroit River and Lake Erie,"An assemblage of six iron 4-pounder guns, recovered from the Detroit River between 1984 and 2011, is contextualized against the military history of the Great Lakes between the founding of Detroit (1701) and the outbreak of the War of 1812 The guns, their condition, and their deployment are used as indexes of the increasing militarization of the region, as French, Native American, British, and American forces contested the control of economic resources and strategic waterways."
2014,Reassessing the Hallowes Site: Conflict and Settlement in the Seventeenth-Century Potomac Valley,"The John Hallowes site in Westmoreland County, Virginia, was excavated from 1968 to 1969 No report of the excavations was completed at that time, although an article summarizing the findings was published in Historical Archaeology in 1971 The artifacts from the site were not systematically cataloged until the 1980s, and it was not until 2010–2012 that an integrated study comparing the artifact data with site features, site history, regional archaeological findings, and regional history was completed Benefiting from nearly 50 years of advances in Chesapeake archaeology, the reanalysis has challenged accepted dates for the site’s initial occupation, resulted in new interpretations of John Hallowes’s role in the Maryland conflict known as Ingle’s Rebellion, traced political alliances formed during that rebellion that led to the creation of the Potomac River community of Appamattucks, and examined changing ideas about military masculinity on the Chesapeake frontier."
2014,"Compositional Characteristics of Jamestown “Tryal” Glass (Virginia, ca 1608)","Glass rinds on small Hessian crucibles from Jamestown are interpreted as samples of the experimental “tryal of glasse” known to have taken place in this early-17th-century Virginia colony Compositional analysis of the rinds indicates that, compared with the glass produced in northern Europe Waldglas), they are strongly enriched in soda and depleted in lime This is hypothesized to result from the use of halophytic plants (sea grass?) in the Jamestown glass batches Imported decorative (beads, dress ornaments) and utilitarian (flat glass, roemer drinking glass) glass items comprise both soda-lime Venetian glass and potash-lime Waldglas, respectively The alkaline/low-Ca ternary composition of Jamestown “tryal” glass thus distinguishes it from these imported wares Environmental changes in the area (e.g., sea-level rise) since the 17th century hamper the identification of locally derived batch ingredients. For example, mass-balance calculations show that the sand used by Jamestown glassworkers was less siliceous than that presently exposed (91% SiO2) on Jamestown Island The novel composition of this “tryal” glass evidently records an adaptation of European glass batch recipes as necessitated by the scarce resources available to the glassworkers at Jamestown."
2014,"Missionaries, Artisans, and Transatlantic Exchange: Production and Distribution of Moravian Pottery in Pennsylvania and the Danish (U.S.) Virgin Islands","The international mission network created in the 18th century by the evangelical Protestant group known as the Unity of Brethren, or Moravians, sustained a consistent set of beliefs and daily practices across widely scattered communities The spiritual unity among the dispersed but cohesive communities in the Moravian Atlantic missions was achieved through the circulated written accounts of each mission’s activities Material culture contributed to the communal approach adopted by the Moravians because the trades practiced in the North American and European communities funded mission work. This included potters who manufactured a slip-decorated, red earthenware, and the Moravian records document that these products were sent from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, to the Danish Caribbean mission The identification of fragments of this Moravian ware at six sites in the Virgin Islands demonstrates material aspects of this transatlantic community, as Moravian missionary ventures represented an intertwined web of religious belief and economics."
2014,"Magic, Religion, and Ritual in Historical Archaeology","This introductory article explores the complex and overlapping concepts of magic, religion, and ritual, and the ways in which archaeologists’ understanding of these concepts informs the interpretation of the material record. A discussion of the development of an historical archaeology of ritual highlights current controversies and deficiencies in the discipline, notably assumptions regarding race and ethnicity. An overview of the themes and topics addressed in the articles in this thematic issue, and their relevance to the broader field of historical archaeology, concludes the paper."
2014,"Four Spiritual Middens in Mid Suffolk, England, ca. 1650 to 1850","Deposits of personal objects, chosen for their ritual associations and hidden in buildings, have been reported in England since the early 20th century. This article examines the evidence for particular ritual concealments in houses in central Suffolk, England, those consisting of numerous objects deliberately deposited in the chimney areas of buildings. Chronological evidence in the layers of these “spiritual middens” demonstrates continual additions over many years. Interpretation of these artifacts suggests that they were concealed to seek protection for the home and its inhabitants. Because so many different types of materials are found in each location, it is possible to argue for a wide range of reasons, to target many different fears, for the selection of specific artifacts by the occupiers. The conclusions drawn from this study may help explain the choice of objects found in other parts of Britain and former British colonial territories in North America and Australia."
2014,Tracing the Footsteps of Ritual: Concealed Footwear in America,"Research concluded by the author in 2003 documented 106 cases of concealed footwear in the United States. Patterns associated with these finds indicate that most, if not all, of these items were concealed for ritual purposes. Historical documentation and popular folklore illustrate the important role that the shoe has played in Western culture for centuries. People ascribed elements of popular magic to the shoe, using it to represent the human form. Shoes were concealed to ensure protection of the home from witches and evil spirits, as part of builders’ traditions, by shoemakers to ensure prosperity, and by grieving persons to preserve loved ones’ spirits. The survival of this practice into the 20th century supports the idea that ritual and magic, instead of disappearing during the enlightened 18th century, were incorporated into modern culture."
2014,The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States,"Research on concealed deposits with ritual significance has been conducted by scholars in continental Europe, the British Isles, and Australia. Similar evidence of the material culture of magic and folk belief in the United States is presented, focusing on ritual deposits hidden within and around domestic structures associated with European American populations. Comparative analysis of three artifact types—witch bottles, concealed footwear, and cats—highlights discrepancies between ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence, and demonstrates temporal, geographical, and spatial patterns in ritual concealments. An overview of other important artifact types illustrates the wide variety of material culture employed in folk rituals in European America. The article concludes with a discussion of regional variation in ritual concealments and the importance of family and household structure, geographic and cultural origin, and cosmology and worldview in private domestic ritual."
2014,Keeping a Crooked Sixpence: Coin Magic and Religion in the Colonial Chesapeake,"This article explores the probability that a silver sixpence, recovered at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River’s Webster Field Annex in St. Inigoes, Maryland, represents an everyday item that had supernatural significance for the individual(s) who once owned it. Between 1637 and 1942, the land that now comprises Webster Field had been home to a Jesuit settlement. Throughout this period, coin magic was practiced in the British Isles, and silver sixpences incorporated many of the symbolic properties that made them useful as protective amulets, emblems of vow-making, and other less defined representations of luck. The presence of such a coin at St. Inigoes is indicative of the interplay between folk traditions and church-sanctioned religious objects employed at the settlement, and coin-bending practices are examined through archaeological finds in the Chesapeake."
2014,Empowered Objects: Material Expressions of Spiritual Beliefs in the Colonial Chesapeake Region,Empowered Objects: Material Expressions of Spiritual Beliefs in the Colonial Chesapeake Region
2014,Double Consciousness and the Intersections of Beliefs in an African American Home in Northern New Jersey,"Archaeological investigations at a house in northwestern New Jersey, owned by a free African American family from 1862 to 1909, identified at least one ritual deposit within the structure. A concealed iron hoe blade was found in the liminal space between the first-story ceiling and the second-story floor, next to the former location of the chimney of the household’s cast-iron stove. Two other possible ritual concealments—a shoe and a brass locket—ere also found within the structure. This article addresses facets of Christian and folk religious beliefs and practices of an African American family living in a predominantly European American neighborhood in the late 19th century."
2014,Irish Immigrant Healing Magic in Nineteenth-Century New York City,"This article presents an Irish magical cure for scrofula, reported by the New York Times in 1858, as a means to discuss the significance of Irish magical healing in the U.S. and how archaeologists might be able to recognize its material traces. Because of how magic has been historically understood in the West, 19th-century Americans used examples of Irish magic to bolster anti-Irish stereotypes and behaviors. Magical healing, nevertheless, was an important and effective strategy for the Irish who suffered from a dramatic increase in illnesses and injuries in the U.S. It was an integral part of their worldview, and it influenced how they interpreted new healing commodities like patent medicines. This article encourages archaeologists to reconsider the importance of magical healing in the past and the present."
2014,Embedded Implication of Cultural Worldviews in the Use and Pattern of Magical Material Culture,"The continuing challenge for archaeologists of ritual and magic revolves around recognition of such beliefs and practices in the archaeological record. This is especially true in contexts where material culture functions as both mundane utilitarian objects and magical devices simultaneously or alternatively. In such cases, mere typologies are insufficient to differentiate magical application from quotidian use. Nor are the most frequently used criteria for distinguishing between magical and non-magical artifact function—irregularities of depositional location—reliable predictors, if the underlying logic of those locations defies articulation. A critical first step in recognizing magical material culture involves understanding the embeddedness of worldviews, particularly aspects of cosmology, in the use and pattern of magical material culture. This article examines the implicated roles of religious frameworks and doctrine with cosmological constructs on “cultural logic” by using an example of 17th-century Anglo-European numerology to illustrate the connection between worldviews and material expression."
2014,The Concealment of Written Blessings in Pennsylvania Barns,"Although the history of the Pennsylvania barn and its migration throughout North America is well-trodden territory in the study of folklife, vernacular architecture, and cultural geography, few scholars have mentioned the presence of a tradition for the concealment of written talismanic blessings in the barns of the Pennsylvania Dutch. Because of the chance circumstances surrounding the discovery of these documents, only a few examples are known to have survived to the present day. This article will examine six specimens of concealed, written barn blessings found in southeastern Pennsylvania, representing a diversity of content ranging from folk-religious inscriptions to astrological symbols, as well as addressing a variety of intentions ranging from folk-medical concerns for livestock to the banishing of perceived hostile spirit entities. These examples provide evidence for an introductory examination of the background and scope of this ritual practice from the early 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century."
2014,"Artifacts to Invoke, Direct, and Deflect","This article provides a guest editor and discussant’s overview of the articles in this thematic issue, points to elements of continuity and contrast across these case studies, and highlights potential avenues for future research and analysis."
2014,Deconstructing the Myth of the “Hand Charm”: Mundane Clothing Fasteners and Their Curious Transformations into Supernatural Objects,"Since the 1970s, the “hand charm” has been recognized in plantation archaeology as an early example of an “Africanism,” a perceived supernatural object within African American life, with roots in African culture and belief. The underpinnings of this interpretation are examined, and the myth of the so-called hand charm deconstructed in two parts: first, in a critical examination, the previous arguments that described these objects—which are ornate hook-and-eye clothing fasteners—as primarily supernatural, are discounted; second, a new explanatory model is offered for how and why these ornamented fasteners made their way into their plantation or African American contexts."
2014,"Enacting Gender and Kinship around a Large Outdoor Fire Pit at the Seneca Iroquois Townley-Read Site, 1715–1754","This article examines a single large outdoor fire pit (Feature 5) from the ca. 1715–1754 Seneca Iroquois Townley-Read site, exploring the untidy intersection of contemporary gender theory, archaeological remains (encompassing artifacts, subsistence remains, features, spatial relations, and contemporaneous mortuary data from the region), and normative conceptions of Iroquois gender roles. While many social categories of people presumably circulated through the feature area, women were consistently present and likely controlled most of the work that took place. The Feature 5 assemblage suggests that Seneca women smoked pipes and worked brass, were involved in complex sets of tasks and “changes of hands” that contributed to subsistence and trade, and labored and demonstrated control over resources and personnel in a way that was not in any sense “private.” The spatial separation of gendered areas of control was one way in which both Seneca kinship and gender identities were performed and reproduced."
2014,Rock-Shelter Saltpeter Mines of Eastern Kentucky,"Saltpeter (niter) is a naturally occurring nitrate mineral historically used to make gunpowder. Domestic production was economically viable only during times of international tension or conflict, when less expensive imports were curtailed. During the period leading up to the War of 1812, speculators and war preparations stimulated a saltpeter boom. Kentucky was the most significant source of nitrates, derived from caves and rock shelters, that supported regional gunpowder mills and was also shipped to eastern manufacturers. Prior research mainly concerned production from limestone caves; sandstone shelters received little notice. The only systematic survey of shelter sites was conducted by archaeologists for the Daniel Boone National Forest in eastern Kentucky, prompted by a need to assess prehistoric cultural resources. Examination of site inventory reports allowed identification of 165 shelter sites associated with saltpeter mining. This information, combined with primary historical documents, has allowed the authors to assess better the nature, distribution, and significance of this early Kentucky industry."
2014,"Of Seals, Sea Lions, and Abalone: The Archaeology of an Historical Multiethnic Base Camp on San Miguel Island, California","Recent archaeological reconnaissance and excavation on western San Miguel Island have uncovered the remains of a multicomponent and multiethnic historical base camp. Surface collections and small-scale testing identified the remains of three late-19th-to early-20th-century hearth features, faunal remains associated with intensive abalone fishing, and evidence for marine-mammal hunting and processing. Although prehistoric, historical, and modern flotsam and jetsam have been mixed by coastal erosion and seal and sea-lion activities, artifact analyses reveal that CA-SMI-614/H was serially occu-pied by the Island Chumash and their ancestors, 19th-century Chinese abalone collectors, early-20th-century Japanese hardhat divers, and European American seal hunters. The site offers a unique glimpse into the historical maritime occupations of southern California and provides critical data on an important but poorly understood period of Pacific Rim history, when fisheries in western North America had become a crucial part of globalized food exports."
2014,"Fan and Tsai: Intracommunity Variation in Plant-Based Food Consumption at the Market Street Chinatown, San Jose, California","Most archaeobotanical research on Chinese immigrant communities in North America has relied on aggregate, site-wide data sets. The question of foodways variability within Chinese immigrant communities has been relatively neglected. An intrasite comparative approach is used here to investigate differences in plant-food consumption between residents of merchant households and those of tenement buildings in the Market Street Chinatown, a major urban Chinese immigrant community in San Jose, California, from 1866 to 1887. Residents of both household types consumed a nutritious diet rich in vegetables and fresh fruits; however, some merchant households consumed greater varieties of cereal grains, while residents of some working-class tenements consumed a wider range of legumes, vegetables, fruits, and nuts. These class-based differences were not consistent, however, suggesting that specific occupation, more than class position, may have influenced access to or preference for certain plant foods."
2014,Assessing Precision in Formula Dating,"Since the advent of pipe stem-bore diameter and mean ceramic date formulas in the 1960s and 1970s, formula dating has been a widely accepted technique for the accurate estimation of median occupation dates of historical sites. The methods are based on fundamental concepts of archaeological analysis: horizon, tradition, and testing by repeated application. These principles allow extension of the methods to prehistoric cases in some circumstances. The formulas, however, produce single numbers that may be misleading in their apparent precision. Datasets from historical sites around the Chesapeake Bay and a synagogue site in Jamaica allow an assessment of the statistical precision of formula dates. The results suggest that archaeologists should report these dates with their standard deviations and not as single-number results."
2014,Toward a Methodology for the Use of Oral Sources in Historical Archaeology,"Recent advances in the use of objects in memory studies and in reminiscence work demonstrate the potential for using objects in archaeological oral-history projects. It is proposed that an artifact-centered interview model provides a framework that is well suited for use in archaeological research. Observations from recent studies in the fields of historical archaeology and memory studies, alongside results from research ongoing at Newcastle University, have informed the development of an artifact-centered approach to oral-data collection. By recognizing that the fragmentary material uncovered through excavation is often unfamiliar to non-archaeologists, the artifact-centered approach uses complete “exemplar” objects to fill the interpretive gap between sherds in artifact bags and actual 19th-century domestic interiors. Results show that exemplar objects are powerful mnemonic aids, and interviews conducted with elderly working-class women in northeastern England demonstrate that it is possible to conduct interviews today that directly influence the interpretation of 19th-century archaeological material."
2014,"The Artifact as Interviewer: Experimenting with Oral History at the Ovenstone Miners’ Cottages Site, Northumberland","The authors introduce a new artifact-centered oral-history methodology and describe its use in interpreting finds from the 19th-century midden associated with a row of cottages at Ovenstone, Northumberland. The history of settlement and excavation at Ovenstone are described, and the evolution and development of the artifact-centered approach is explored. Four case studies are presented in order to illustrate some of the ways in which oral testimonies have informed the interpretation of artifacts from the Ovenstone midden. Each of these examples draws directly on the memories and experiences of community elders who were interviewed for the Ovenstone Project between 2009 and 2012."
2014,“And in Every Hamlet a Poet”: Gaelic Oral Tradition and Postmedieval Archaeology in Scotland,"The archaeological study of the postmedieval Scottish Highlands has engaged little with Gaelic oral tradition. The period from 1700 saw the gradual decline of the Gaelic language and the society and culture that supported it. Events and processes such as the Jacobite rebellions (1715 and 1745), 18th-century agricultural improvement, and the 19th-century Highland Clearances made the postmedieval era a turbulent one for both individuals and ways of life. Oral tradition played a key part in Gaelic society throughout this period and is invaluable as a form of evidence for postmedieval society and culture. Previous archaeological approaches are discussed, and the range of available evidence is outlined in order to demonstrate that archaeological engagement with oral sources can greatly enrich the understanding of Scotland’s past."
2014,Archaeology and Oral History in Northumberland,"This paper is largely based on interviews collected or overseen in Northumberland by the authors since 2003. It summarizes the way in which oral history has been used by British historians and describes an evolving approach to researching the interaction between landscape and community. Focusing on stock management, the authors discuss how insight into activities carried out beyond living memory can be gained using descriptions and interpretations of landscape features provided by current farmers and shepherds. A case study exemplifies how the combining of oral testimony, historical map research, and archaeological fieldwork has made possible the verification of an historical drover’s route in Northumberland. It is concluded that archaeology can be used to identify the surviving physical correlates of activities recorded in oral accounts, while oral history can enhance the dynamic interpretation of archaeological finds, interpretations that might otherwise only be assumed."
2014,"“Jowel, Jowel and Listen Lad”: Vernacular Song and the Industrial Archaeology of Coal Mining in Northern England","The author explores the problems and potentials of vernacular song and verse as sources for an “ethnography” of historical industrial production in northern England, with particular reference to the northeastern coal industry. The work seeks to contextualize the political and social contingency of work-related song and verse in the coalfields, and suggests that the surviving, exceedingly rich, oral tradition of the region can give important insights into the social relations that operationalized the means of industrial production, relations that would otherwise be missing from traditional industrial archaeological approaches to the study of mines and miners."
2014,From Knowing into Telling: A Dialogue in Five Parts,"The issues raised by different kinds of oral-historical research are explored here through a dialogue between two projects. In one case, the Alderley Sandhills Project, this work has been completed; in the other, the Ardnamurchan Transitions Project, the oral-historical research is in its early stages. Through a series of interactions, this article raises a number of different questions that oral-historical research posed at Alderley Sandhills, and it considers the ramifications of and the possible differences in these questions in the case of Ardnamurchan. Adoption of a nonlinear structure echoes one of the many fascinating aspects of oral-historical research itself."
2014,Conversations and Material Memories: Insights into Outback Household Practices at the Old Kinchega Homestead,"Since 1996, the Kinchega Archaeological Research Project (KARP) has been conducting a household archaeology project at the late-19th- to mid-20th-century Old Kinchega Homestead in outback New South Wales, Australia. The research is driven by investigations of the homestead’s material remains, but interactions with the local community are providing oral and documentary evidence that play a significant role, both as a contextual framework and in steering the project’s research agenda. This article discusses how different people, and different types of interactions and processes involved in gathering personal histories throughout the project, are impacting the interpretative procedures used for investigating household consumption practices at Old Kinchega Homestead."
2014,The Rhetoric of Things: Historical Archaeology and Oral History,"This paper examines precisely how objects assume meanings in archaeological interpretation and a dimension of everyday life and experience that exists on the fringes of self-consciousness. Archaeologists interpret the meanings of material things in ways that have often sought to erase the ambiguities of material symbolism in conventional linear narratives, but oral memories routinely struggle with the meaning of things and underscore their complex and ambiguous meanings. The paper examines how the contributors to this volume illuminate the implications of oral memories on broader material culture scholarship both within and beyond historical archaeology."
2013,"“Built for the Publick Worship of God, according to the Church of England”: Anglican Landscapes and Colonialism in South Carolina","In 1706, the Church of England became the established church of South Carolina. Construction of several churches began shortly thereafter under the supervision of local parish supervisors. Archaeological testing at the 1707 St. Paul’s Parish Church indicates parish supervisors purposely altered the church’s orientation from the traditional east-west orientation in order to make it more of a presence on the landscape. A subsequent regional landscape study of other early-18th-century South Carolina Anglican churches suggests that throughout the colony church supervisors strategically placed churches on the landscape to be material expressions of the Anglican Church’s presence and power in the culturally and ethnically divided colony. As a consequence of the intentional placement of churches on the landscape, the South Carolina Anglican Church played a larger role in the development of the colony by affecting the expansion of transportation networks and, later, settlement patterns."
2013,Messages in a Map: French Depictions of the 1730 Meskwaki Fort,"In 1730, French and allied tribes besieged an expedient fortification hastily constructed by the Meskwaki in a small oak grove on the central Illinois prairie. Three written narratives and four maps produced by the French shortly after the battle agree in many ways, but the maps differ dramatically in how they depict the fort’s geometry. The one produced in New Orleans and showing an irregularly shaped fortification corresponds most closely to the archaeological deposits revealed by a magnetic gradient survey and ground-truthing excavations. Multiple lines of evidence converge to force the conclusion that 11ML6 is the location of the 1730 fortification. More broadly, several factors are discussed that may help account for the confusing variations observed among the four maps, including cultural and professional biases, motives of personal aggrandizement, and differences in the maps’ intended functions and stages of refinement."
2013,The Role of Technological Transitions in the Development of American Ceramic Industries: Elijah Cornell and the Shift from Redware to Stoneware Production,"In the mid-1800s, the construction of canal and rail networks profoundly affected ceramic manufacturing in New York State by lowering the cost of transporting stoneware clay and finished vessels. Consumer demand for stoneware storage containers, energized by lower prices and increased availability, spurred the development of stoneware potteries across the state. Many American earthenware potters shifted partially or entirely over to stoneware production. This paper contends that the difficult transition between ceramic manufacturing technologies played a role in the decline of the handicraft pottery industry in the early 20th century. Stoneware production required firsthand instruction, large capital investments and resource networks, new labor structures, and an understanding of changing consumer expectations. The analysis uses documentary and archaeological evidence from the potter Elijah Cornell as a case study of technological change in the operation of a traditional American earthenware business."
2013,A Taphonomic Evaluation of Three Intact Pork Barrels from the Steamboat Heroine (1838),"This study focuses on three pork barrels from the cargo of the Heroine, a steamboat that wrecked on the Red River in 1838 while carrying provisions to the U.S. Army garrison at Fort Towson, Oklahoma. The quantity and quality of the meat, as evidenced by the bones in the barrels, are examined to establish whether the meat matched the military contract, to ascertain the pork butchery and packaging procedures, and to determine any standardization in the types and quantities of pieces in the barrels. The results suggest that the meat represents a midgrade pork and generally agree with the quality expected by the military. Analyses reveal that processing was similar to modern-day practices. Finally, a comparison of the bones illustrates a lack of standardization among the barrels. This research provides important information about pig processing and military-contract compliance, two areas that have not been extensively studied previously."
2013,"Archaeology and Religion at the Hyde Park Barracks Destitute Asylum, Sydney","Religion and spirituality have often been neglected by historical archaeologists, in spite of the importance of religious devotion in public and private life. Recent investigation of artifacts from the Hyde Park Barracks Destitute Asylum in Sydney, Australia, however, has begun to shed new light on the role of spirituality in an institutional context. An extensive underfloor collection from the asylum includes many paper fragments from the Bible and from religious tracts, along with rosaries and devotional medals. This material suggests that while visiting clergymen and missionaries distributed large quantities of “improving” literature, the inmates expressed their own religious feelings in more personal, private ways. The archaeological and historical evidence also indicates that Catholic inmates were separated from Anglicans and others, mirroring the wider sectarian division in 19th-century Australia."
2013,"Application of Dendrochronology to Historical Charcoal-Production Sites in the Great Basin, United States","During the Comstock mining era of the late 1800s, forested lands in the North American Great Basin were used for charcoal production to fuel mining smelters and related industries. Archaeological studies within or near mining districts include assessments of charcoal-production sites when such remnant features are present. Minimal historical documentation exists for individual production sites, and so the science of dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) is used to provide calendar dates and other information on the nature of historical activity within forests and woodlands. A synthesis of the dendrochronological approach to historical charcoal-production investigation is presented in the context of four recent studies, including a comprehensive strategy, new processing techniques, and unique results. This approach provides charcoal-production archaeologists with precise temporal and spatial data that are applied to questions such as patterns and timing of deforestation, or differences in technology and practices among immigrant laborers."
2013,"NAGPRA and Historical Research: Reevaluation of a Multiple Burial from Fort Union National Monument, New Mexico","An inadvertent discovery of a mass burial dating to April 1862 at Fort Union National Monument, New Mexico, uncovered four sets of human remains. In the authors’ opinion, at least one set has likely been inappropriately repatriated to the Jicarilla Apache and Ute Mountain Ute tribes during a Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) process. We review the historical record and suggest an interpretation for the deaths that is alternative to that offered by a cultural affiliation study. We suggest that use of professional historical archaeologists and historians might have avoided what we believe was an inappropriate repatriation of an Hispanic New Mexico Volunteer under NAGPRA."
2013,Changing the Past for the Present and the Future,"The power of narrative lies in its ability to actively shape the representations of the past that form collective memory. Narratives of the past can be about power relations, and they can provide a map to help archaeologists think about the past and the present. They can reinforce and naturalize ideas about inequalities in resources and social relations. Unchallenged, these inequalities become part of a naturalized everyday existence. The authors in this volume use historical archaeology as a form of political action to challenge the dominant narrative and develop different ways of looking at the past. These new perspectives also have an impact on the way archaeologists view the present"
2013,Native American Historical Archaeology and the Trope of Authenticity,"This essay argues that historical archaeology has the potential to complicate and challenge colonial narratives of authenticity, not only in the rich data that it collects and studies, but also in the ways in which it goes about collecting these data. Case studies from colonial New England exemplify the nuanced perspectives on native spirituality and community cohesion offered via historical archaeology. These complex and variegated archaeological histories have the potential to break the dichotomous tropes inherent in public understandings of colonialism. Recent historical archaeological research with the Brothertown Indian Nation also serves to demonstrate the ways in which critical, collaborative, and pragmatic approaches can challenge colonial narratives on a local scale."
2013,"Lonely Men, Loose Women: Rethinking the Demographics of a Multiethnic Mining Camp, Kanaka Flat, Oregon","The historiography of the Western gold rushes is punctuated with rhetoric of the American Wild West. The mining camp in particular has become an institution of the traditional frontier narrative, biasing interpretations of the composition of early mining settlements. Historical and modern accounts of Kanaka Flat describe a lack of women, yet archaeological data and documentary evidence indicated women were present and integrated into the community. Low-status Indian or Hawaiian women on Kanaka Flat were disregarded and not seen as legitimate partners or wives, suggesting that the idea of “women” often referenced more than sex or gender, but also ethnicity and class. Archaeological investigations challenge dated frontier archetypes, allowing recognition of the diversity of experiences on the American frontier. The “invisible wives” of Kanaka Flat illustrate that the camp was not a haven of single men and sinful women, but a complex community comprised of both bachelors and families."
2013,Reversing the Narrative of Hillbilly History: A Case Study Using Archaeology at Van Winkle’s Mill in the Arkansas Ozarks,"One of the most powerful and pervasive narratives at work in the Arkansas Ozark Mountains is that of the “hillbilly.” This narrative emphasizes ruralness, whiteness, and an antimodern attitude that both frames how the world sees the Ozarks and how Arkansans see themselves. Since 1997, archaeological investigations have been ongoing at Van Winkle’s Mill, the site of a late-19th-century sawmill community in the Arkansas Ozarks. This multidisciplinary research endeavor has provided important information about the African diaspora in the Ozarks and also aided in the understanding of the industrialization and modernization of the region. Most importantly, it provided a platform for public history that may shed light on the processes of remembering and forgetting at work in Ozark history that have led to the proliferation of myths about the Ozark past and the erasure of a rich African American heritage in the region."
2013,Demystifying the Hidden Hand: Capital and the State at Blair Mountain,"The Battle of Blair Mountain is an important episode in American and world history that illuminates central tenets of the current American socioeconomic system. The artifacts from the battle as well as documentary evidence and oral history show that the events of the battle are part of a larger system of exploitation that continues today. Initial analysis of the artifacts from the battle allows insight into fundamental workings of the emergence and maintenance of capitalism. Archaeological work has been central in addressing issues and injustices within this system, as shown in preservation work at Blair Mountain."
2013,Camp Nelson and Kentucky’s Civil War Memory,"It has often been said that Kentucky joined the Confederacy after the Civil War. While this statement might seem absurd, it has had powerful ramifications for how the Civil War is interpreted. After the Civil War, Kentucky promoted the “Lost Cause” narrative of the war, which denied the central place of slavery and emancipation, and further denied that African American soldiers and civilians made significant contributions to the Union victory. As a large U.S. Army supply depot and Kentucky’s largest U.S. Army African American military and refugee camp, Camp Nelson is a contradiction to this traditional Kentucky Civil War narrative as it illustrates both the state’s pro-Union stance and the contributions made by its African American population. Through the use of historical documents and archaeology, Camp Nelson Civil War Heritage Park is attempting to create a new Kentucky Civil War narrative, one that includes the experiences and contributions of African American soldiers and refugees."
2013,"From Nuisance to Nostalgia: The Historical Archaeology of Nature Tourism in Southern California, 1890–1940","Between the comparatively brief period of 1890 to 1940, Southern California tourism resorts and tourists visiting the region exhibited conflicting feelings toward the region’s wildlife and natural resources. On the one hand, from 1910 to 1930, nature was seen by some Americans as a popular attraction, yet, on the other, some capitalists perceived it as an impediment to the industrialization and imperial expansion efforts underway in the western United States. Drawing upon historical and archaeological data from railway workers employed at one of the most popular tourist attractions in turn-of-the-century Southern California, this article shows the changing meanings and uses of the tourist landscape. At the same time I develop a case for the development of an historical archaeology of tourism."
2013,Beyond the Battle: New Narratives at Monocacy National Battlefield,"Long recognized as the site of an important Civil War battle, considerable energy has been invested in educating the public about Monocacy National Battlefield. In the past decade, archaeologists have pursued multiple research projects at Monocacy in order to expand interpretation of the site and provide broader context for the battle. Most recently, excavations were undertaken to explore the slave village associated with an 18th- and 19th-century plantation, L’Hermitage. Though the data have not yet been fully incorporated into Monocacy’s interpretive materials, they form the basis of an alternative to the traditional battlefield narrative."
2013,Rewriting Narratives of Labor Violence: A Transnational Perspective of the Lattimer Massacre,"The Lattimer Massacre transpired over the course of five minutes in September of 1897. Following the event, the public has contested its meaning for more than a century. Two major narratives have framed the importance of the event in academic and popular discourse. Within labor history, the significance of the event lies in its role in inspiring a coalition between new immigrants and native-born miners. Within the narrative of immigrant social history, it is about the assertion of ethnic identity within American pluralism. From contemporary perspective, there is a risk of overlooking important lessons in this history in disarticulating these processes. In their infancy at the time of the massacre, ideologies of racialization and national belonging are central to many contemporary debates about border control, government entitlement, and globalized economy. The Lattimer Massacre Project, begun in 2009, is a multidisciplinary exploration of the event and the uses of its memory."
2013,Reversing the Narrative from Violence to Peace: Some Thoughts from an Archaeologist,"Archaeologists with ambitions to be relevant, ethical, and useful can decide to confront difficult, deeply embedded current problems. We archaeologists have the power of narrative. Narratives are what drive us; they are what we teach each other. They reinforce what we believe, repeat, cite, and fund—both within the discipline and in the stories we return to the public sphere. In Life and Death Matters, Barbara Rose Johnston raises the crucial question: “Can we build environmentally sound and socially just solutions to our problems in ways that minimize or prevent the incidence of violent conflict?” How will archaeologists employ narrative tactics to respond?"
2013,Excavating the Quiet History of a Providence Plantation,"In November 2010, 78% of Rhode Islanders elected not to eliminate the second half of the state’s official name, “Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.” The debate over removing “Providence Plantations” suggests the selective historical memory of both civic leaders and citizens, who have forgotten the impacts and legacy of colonization in the 17th century. During the early settlement of Rhode Island, planting and plantations were explicit tools of European colonization involving many forms of oppression. Evidence from the 17th-century Old House site at Greene Farm, a former plantation in Warwick, Rhode Island, depicts a multicultural landscape and community increasingly dominated by the Greenes, an influential English family. An examination of changes in the documentary record, material culture, and lived environment related to Greene Farm between 1642 and 1711 maps the aggressive use of plantations by English settlers to permanently colonize a place and its original inhabitants, and considers how these acts of “planting” served to reinforce the development and maintenance of their New English identity."
2013,A Hybrid Identity in a Pluralistic Nineteenth-Century Colonial Context,"The colonial process often occurs within a pluralistic context in which all the actors continuously renegotiate their identities. Traditionally, this context has been framed within a colonizer/colonized dichotomy, but recent scholarship has embraced a more-complex interpretation, such that colonizers and colonized are not homogenizing categories, and variations in experience are accepted. The deconstruction of colonial categories further complicates pluralistic contexts and allows for a more nuanced reading of the past; however, the colonial discourse continues to have difficulty exploring and discussing identities that do not fit neatly into either a colonizer or colonized identity. This paper explores how the Labrador Métis, a self-defined hybrid identity, do not cleanly fit within the current discourse and highlights the need to begin reconceptualizing the actors within the colonial process."
2013,"Digging through Twentieth-Century Rubbish at Hani, Ghana","Two 20th-century rubbish dumps were sampled at the modern village of Hani, in Ghana, located where the former city-state of Begho existed from the 14th until the 19th century. The dumps lay within a gallery forest surrounding the settlement, in a zone where village latrines are also found. The rubbish dumps contained material that provided connections between the archaeological data from Begho and the modern material culture revealed by a longitudinal ethnoarchaeological study of Hani. The exercise demonstrated the significance of rubbish-dump archaeology for understanding continuities from past to present. In scale, and from the organic nature of the refuse, differences are indicated with the well-defined “garbology” (Rathje and Murphy 1992) characteristic of developed industrial societies. The research also has the potential for throwing light on the impacts of colonialism on material culture in the first half of the 20th century."
2013,"Women and Class in Landlord Villages of the Tehran Plain, Iran","This paper explores the presence of women in the landlord villages of the Tehran Plain, Iran, drawing on recent fieldwork in the form of spatial analysis of the built environment, ethnographic interviews, excavation, and analysis of material culture assemblages. The visibility of women in the buildings and material culture of the villages is assessed and compared to the evidence gained through interview. Given the acknowledged importance of class as a social structure, analysis and discussion is extended to consider whether it is possible to distinguish women of different classes in the villages. Although largely ignored in many previous historical and ethnographic accounts, it is clear that women have played a key role in these villages, and that they can be detected in the material culture. While the ethnographic evidence and spatial analysis indicate the presence of different classes of women, determining this from the artifactual assemblages alone is very difficult.
q ]My story is about ordinary women like myself, whose lives were transformed by events in the late twentieth century. My story is about Iran, or Persia, and the women of Iran whose popular history barely exists. We have had thousands of poets, writers and historians who across the centuries have left a rich cultural heritage. None the less, women are rarely mentioned as creators and mentors of the society. They are hidden behind curtains and high walls (Shafii 1997:xii–xiii)."
2013,"Locating the Pre-Clearance Forest Border at Fort Necessity, Great Meadows, Pennsylvania, Using Pollen Analysis","The forest border position was critical in the brief 1754 siege of George Washington’s Fort Necessity at Great Meadows, Pennsylvania. Pollen analysis of core transects across the meadow and up the adjacent hillsides provided evidence of the location of the pre-clearance forest border to within a 20 ft. interval on seven of eight core transects and within 40 ft. on the eighth. This could not have been accomplished with the lake and bog palynology characteristic of palaeoecological palynology. Reconstruction of the historical period vegetation of specific plots requires investigation of the soil-pollen spectra of the target location itself. Pollen percolates downward in soil profiles, allowing the analyst to recognize the pollen spectra of the target time period, and published empirical studies of horizontal predeposition pollen transport assist the investigator in defining vegetation changes across space."
2013,The Paradox of the Paniolo: An Archaeological Perspective of Hawaiian Ranching,"Commercial ranches are part of Hawai‘i’s colonial landscape and form an expansive archaeological horizon in rural parts of the islands. Ranching facilitated the evolution of folk societies of cowboys (paniolo) who incorporated Hawaiian language and values in daily working activities despite the multiethnic origins and nontraditional occupations of the workers. The archaeology of these communities in upland pastures of the Humu‘ula district on the eastern slopes of Hawai‘i Island is presented herein. The study provides an enhanced understanding of the evolution of colonial identities through multiple scales of analysis, including social, economic, and environmental responses of the rise of industrial capitalism, trends in vernacular architecture, engendered analyses of living floors, and microhistories embedded in individual artifacts."
2013,The World Is What It Is: The Role of Subjectivity and Personal Experience in Global Historical Archaeologies,"The 2013 Society for Historical Archaeology conference plenary session (sponsored by the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology) was held on the themes of “globalization, immigration, transformation.” Representatives of all six permanently inhabited continents presented brief case studies derived from their work on those continents, before engaging in discussion of the conference themes from their different, complex, and multilayered international perspectives. The present issue of Historical Archaeology offers more detailed case studies from the original speakers (in one case with a coauthor). This introduction seeks to place these multifaceted approaches within a framework foregrounding the role of personal experience as an explanatory approach to understanding the differences within a global historical archaeology that is not just global and multicultural in theme, but also in practice."
2013,Argentina and Great Britain: Studying an Asymmetrical Relationship through Domestic Material Culture,"For Argentina, and particularly Buenos Aires, no economic relations were more intense in the 19th century than those it maintained with Great Britain. Its whole industrial, trade, and financial structure depended on Britain, despite the fact that Argentina was not a colony, nor was there a British military force or a centralized institutional system to defend investments. The origins of this relationship can be traced to the events of the late 18th century, when consumer goods from Great Britain achieved absolute supremacy in Buenos Aires due to certain peculiarities in the city’s history."
2013,"Great Zimbabwe in Historical Archaeology: Reconceptualizing Decline, Abandonment, and Reoccupation of an Ancient Polity, A.D. 1450–1900","A recent anthropological critique of the archaeology and cultural heritage management of Great Zimbabwe refers to “the silence of unheard voices and untold stories,” “the unrepresented pasts of local communities,” and “the silence of anger—the alienation—and desecration of Great Zimbabwe” (Fontein 2006). Fontein sees a lack of representation of local histories, not only in the literature, but also in museum displays and in the archaeological narratives (Pikirayi 2001), including heritage management reports (Ndoro 2005). Admittedly, this is one of the reasons why Great Zimbabwe is a contested site and cultural landscape. In this paper it is argued that Great Zimbabwe’s contribution to the understanding of the origins of later Karanga and other regional histories is poorly understood. Archaeology, in collaboration with other disciplines, can play a useful role in writing the story of Great Zimbabwe and—in keeping with the plenary session themes—relating it to other transformative global developments of the early modern era, when the site was clearly experiencing decline and eventual abandonment. Detailed local histories, though useful in understanding sociopolitical dynamics on the Zimbabwe Plateau, may account for the invisibility of Great Zimbabwe since A.D. 1550 until its “discovery” by Europeans during the late 19th century. Underlying these processes is the failure by archaeologists to understand decline or collapse of a sociopolitical system once based at Great Zimbabwe, and its global implications."
2013,"Globalization, Immigration, and Transformation: Thoughts from a European Perspective","Historical archaeology as an archaeology of the modern world is greatly dominated in Europe by British research. Nevertheless, the discipline is gradually gaining a foothold in other European countries as well. This paper looks at the contribution that historical archaeology can make to the subjects of globalization, immigration, and transformation from a European perspective and how it relates to them. Three issues are dealt with: Is Europe, as the “missing link,” conducive to the formation of a global historical archaeology? What are the topics of research that can contribute to its creation from a European perspective? What role does the interplay between globalization and nationalism play in all of this?"
2013,"Maritime Archaeology and Sri Lanka: Globalization, Immigration, and Transformation in the Underwater Archaeological Record","Assuming that maritime archaeology conducted in Sri Lanka is new to most readers, the present paper has been written with a dual purpose. First, it tries to give some background to the birth and growth of the discipline in this country and shows its involvement in ICOMOS—ICUCH (International Council on Monuments and Sites—International Committee on the Underwater Cultural Heritage) activities. Second, it tries to deal with the focus of the 2013 SHA conference by addressing three sites, each of which can be developed into a case study relating to the conference themes. Sri Lanka was always a place where East/West shipping interacted, whether before or after A.D. 1500, and was also always conscious of the looming presence of India. This paper, however, deals only with material aspects in the period after 1500."
2013,Colonialism and the Peel Island Lazaret: Changing the World One Story at a Time,"Archaeology tells interpretive stories about the past. My experiences as a migrant to Australia and my working-class background have created the archaeologist that I am and the stories of the past that I choose to tell. Here I reflect on my own childhood and early adulthood, and their impacts on my archaeological practice and my affinity with Aboriginal political ambitions. An investigation of the embedded and institutionalized racism experienced by Aboriginal inmates of the Peel Island Lazaret is used as a case study to express my desire to change the world one story at a time."
2013,Living Side by Side: Approaching Coexistence through Narrative,"As postmodernism has created a cultural marker out of individual difference, it has allowed archaeologists to place themselves in settings that are only tenuously connected to collective pasts. These settings are often arbitrary or expedient rather than durable. The author argues that it is erosion of confidence in the ability to acknowledge and characterize the fact of a common ground that impedes archaeologists from engaging with the shared archive of relational resources from which identity is drawn today, in particular through the mechanism of narrative. In examining narrative as a way of bridging between difference and commonality, its archaeological applicability is highlighted through a case study on 18th-century New England; with reference to the transcultural spaces inhabited by English and Native Americans, narrative reconstruction is employed to theorize the character of coexistence and the interpenetration of cultural spaces, and to lead to insights on material culture associated with the experiences of coexistence."
2013,Pieces of Many Puzzles: Network Approaches to Materiality in the Global Era,"To explore themes of globalization, immigration, and transformation requires a complex multiscalar perspective on material culture. But how can this daunting task be meaningfully undertaken? As a discussion of papers delivered at the Leicester 2013 SHA conference, this contribution considers the possibilities offered by network-based approaches to social analysis. It explores the potentials of both actor network theory (ANT) and more recent science and technology studies (STS) as two theoretical approaches explicitly focused on the conjunctures and disjunctions that both enable and constrain flows of knowledge, migration, and commodity trade. What would be the archaeological implications of this focus on material “relationality?” p][T]here are gaps even between things that are contiguous, gaps that are affirmations, pieces of a puzzle belonging not to any one puzzle but to many, pieces assembled by forcing them into a certain place where they may or may not belong, their unmatched edges violently forced out of shape, forcibly made to fit together, to interlock, with a number of pieces always left over (Deleuze and Guattari 2004:46)."
2012,“Their Houses are Ancient and Ordinary”: Archaeology and Connecticut’s Eighteenth-Century Domestic Architecture,"The 18th-century houses that dot Connecticut’s landscape have come to be the very symbols of the state’s colonial past. Recent archaeological investigations at the buried remains of six period homesteads indicate that Connecticut’s domestic architecture was far more varied and dynamic than conventionally believed. Excavations revealed the continuation of ancient English house forms, including small one-room end-chimney and long and narrow cross-passage types. The excavations also provide new information on construction techniques, household material culture, food storage, and everyday lifeways of Connecticut’s middling sort, who formed the largest population sector, but about whom little is known from documentary sources.

2012,Evaluating Spanish Colonial Alternative Economies in the Archaeological Record,"The Spanish settlement of Santa María de Galve (1698–1719), a presidio in northwest Florida, was in a precarious economic position from the moment of its establishment. The Spanish Crown prohibited trading with foreigners and expected the colonists to survive on the unreliable situado supply system. This insufficient system may have spurred colonists to participate in illegal activities to support their economic interests. In complex colonial situations such as this, it is necessary for archaeologists to consider illicit activity as a possible source of goods when interpreting artifact assemblages. According to historical documents, throughout its occupation the presidio of Santa María de Galve only received five shipments of ceramics in the situado, yet, as is common on archaeological sites, ceramics dominate the artifact assemblage. A possible explanation for the abundance of ceramics might be that colonists attained ceramics through illicit means. In doing so, the colonists created a different kind of economy, one that became alternative to the legal and formal economy of Spain. This case study provides one way of examining illicit trade by applying diversity statistics to ceramic assemblages from refuse-pit features in status-assigned areas at Santa María de Galve. The results demonstrate a higher diversity index in areas occupied or regulated by higher-status military officials, indicating that illicit trade might have been used to some degree to obtain ceramics that were not available through the situado."
2012,Pueblo Potsherds to Silver Spoons: A Case Study in Historical Archaeology from New Mexico,"The relationship between documentary and material sources continues to be a source for considerable debate within historical archaeology. Using a case study from northern New Mexico as an example, this article illuminates the material availability enjoyed by 18th- and early-19th-century Hispanos residing in the Santa Fe River valley. Testament inventories from colonial inhabitants are compared with archaeological assemblages from residential sites of the same area and period to expose two very different emphases in material culture. Relevant documents focus on tools and status items, often imported. The archaeological collections, however, consist mostly of utility ceramics obtained from Pueblo Indian communities. Why does such a contrast exist between the two sources of information? Self-identification represented by documents suggests deliberate and genuine, but uneven, Spanish cultural participation. Yet the archaeological record hints more at a type of “transculturation” occurring at least at the level of everyday material culture reflecting recent ethnogenetic models of multidirectional cultural exchanges in the Spanish Borderlands."
2012,"Hard Labor and Hostile Encounters: What Human Remains Reveal about Institutional Violence and Chinese Immigrants Living in Carlin, Nevada (1885–1923)","This article identifies activity-related changes to, traumatic injuries on, and pathological conditions of the human remains of the Chinese immigrants from Carlin, Nevada, who were interred between 1885 and 1923. Chinese males came to the Americas to work as railroad laborers and miners, and when the railroad was completed many went home, but some found work in small towns. In Carlin, Chinese immigrants were employed as merchants, shopkeepers, cooks, laundry workers, and a variety of other occupations. Within this immigrant group, there were differences in the degree of physical labor each individual experienced. According to historical records, this was a time of increasing anti-Chinese sentiments, and there are accounts of intergroup conflict with the politically dominant settlers. However, little is known about the biological correlates of this sociopolitical inequality. An analysis of these correlates is assessed as a means for understanding patterns of social, economic, and political inequality between these immigrants and the local population. The findings demonstrate that socioeconomic and political inequality experienced by the Carlin individuals resulted in high rates of activity-induced changes, trauma, and pathological conditions. Furthermore, examination of the relationship between cranial trauma and other types of skeletal injuries supports research that has shown trauma to the head can predispose people to other types of trauma (accidental or deliberate). The results support the historical accounts of the time that indicate hard physical labor, accidental or deliberate trauma, and interpersonal conflict were part of the life history of this group of Chinese immigrants."
2012,"Mapping the Complexities of Race on the Landscape of the Colonial Caribbean, United States Virgin Islands, 1770–1917","Colonial race relations in the Virgin Islands developed as a graded color/class system that invested the category of whiteness with power and blackness with slavery. Between the two ends of the socioracial spectrum a population of freepersons of color emerged. Examination of two landscapes, one rural and the other urban, demonstrates how socially defined racial groups used landscapes to create, maintain, and transform racial identities. Focus on a Moravian estate landscape in each setting reveals a strong commitment to the ideology of white superiority espoused by the colonial authorities and landowning elite. After freepersons of color were granted full citizenship (1830) and the abolition of slavery (1848), socially defined racial groups in rural and urban settings used distinctly different spatial and social strategies to make claims about their racial identities in an environment of continued white privilege."
2012,Marronage Perspective for Historical Archaeology in the United States,"Historical archaeologists in the U.S. have been interested in resistance among enslaved African diasporans for several decades. Marronage has often been noted as being a forceful and powerful example of captive resistance in these discussions. Generally, our understandings of U.S. marronage have been shaped by perceptions of the process that severely downplay its social, identificatory, cultural, and politicoeconomic impacts. Equally important, national academic and public discourses have long misinterpreted relevant phenomena, such as the Underground Railroad, in ways that undermine the realization of the expansiveness, historical gravity, and African diasporic roots of marronage in the U.S. There is thus a need for a perspective on the phenomenon of marronage in the U.S that accurately recognizes its origins, scope, scale, and complexity. In establishing the basis for this more inclusive marronage perspective, attention will turn to developing a preliminary archaeological model for the recovery of information about marronage in a variety of disparate site contexts."
2012,The Panamá Viejo Archaeological Project: More than a Decade of Research and Management of Heritage Resources,"The city of Panama was founded on 15 August 1519 and was the first Spanish port on the American Pacific coast. In 1671 the city was destroyed by the pirate Henry Morgan. The archaeological site of Panamá Viejo was declared a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2003. The archaeological department of Patronato Panamá Viejo, the institution responsible for site management, has designed a long-term plan that involves survey, excavation, analysis, conservation, curation of collections, education, and general and specialized promotion. The site-management structure, including fundraising, is innovative and original for the region. This paper presents a synthesis of more than a decade of archaeological research at the site, the legal framework in which it takes place, and its significance in the regional context."
2012,An Archaeological Glimpse of the Slave Trade in Late-Seventeenth-Century Panama,"While the development of slave societies in Spanish America has long been a popular and well-researched topic in Western historiography, archaeological accounts of this process outside the direct area of influence of African American archaeology are still rare. In Spanish-speaking Latin America, few studies have looked into the material universe in which the foundations of a racially based system of inequality were laid. An outline is offered here of the preliminary results of the first project specifically addressing the materiality of the slave trade in the late-17th-century city of Panama, one of the main centers of human traffic in the Spanish colonial world. Detaching itself from traditional perspectives of the African experience in the New World, this investigation analyzes the lived space of local slave traders, seeking to identify evidences of their cultural vulnerability vis-à-vis the commodified African people these merchants bought and sold. This evidence, it is hoped, may contribute to the future development of effective, empowering narratives of the slave trade for African-descendant communities in Latin America and elsewhere."
2012,"Speaking in Spanish, Eating in English; Ideology and Meaning in Nineteenth-Century British Transfer Prints in Barcelona, Anzoátegui State, Venezuela","Nineteenth-century transfer-printed ceramics have often been seen as a vehicle for the transmission of various kinds of ideological imagery. Understandably, this past work has largely focused on the United Kingdom and the United States, the country of manufacture of most transfer prints and the largest market for British pottery exports, respectively. As the global British ceramics industry expanded over the course of the 19th century, however, British merchants were expanding into other markets. The second largest of these for pottery exports, after the United States, was South America. The ideological meanings that archaeologists ascribe to transfer-printed ceramics in the North Atlantic World often take on a very different ideological context once the ceramics are exported to South America. A ceramics assemblage from the coastal Venezuelan city of Barcelona provides an opportunity to study these shifting ideological meanings within one South American context."
2012,"The Dark Side of Toys in Nineteenth-Century Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Investigations have been conducted at historical sites in Rio de Janeiro examining different domains of 19th-century material culture. The major goal of this research consists of analyzing a phenomenon peculiar to the formation of Brazilian society, namely the introduction of a bourgeois lifestyle, typical of capitalist societies, amid the slavery system that was still fully in force in the country. This ambiguity generated mixtures of modernities and archaisms, blending new forms of behavior with the traditional worldview of the colonial system. Powerful conveyors of nonverbal messages, toys are a type of material culture that constitutes a key domain for observing the forms engendered by a sociocultural system to ensure its own perpetuation. Through toys, it is possible to examine the moral values and social roles subliminally instilled in children. However, the ways in which children reacted to this indoctrination—mostly visible in their games but not in their toys—are more difficult to observe in the archaeological record."
2012,"Contours of Labor and History: A Diachronic Perspective on Andean Mineral Production and the Making of Landscapes in Porco, Bolivia","The first Spanish silver mines in South America were located in Porco, Bolivia, and while these were rapidly eclipsed by the spectacular output from nearby Potosí, Porco has remained an important mining center until the present. The long-term history of mineral production is embodied in the landscape, which bears evidence of a diverse set of labor practices and technologies deployed at different scales to process ore. A decade of archaeological research at Porco demonstrates the role this landscape has played in mediating the relationship between indigenous workers and the broader political and economic forces that prevailed under the Inka, Spanish, and Republican regimes."
2012,"Body Marks, Pots, and Pipes: Some Correlations between African Scarifications and Pottery Decoration in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Brazil","Some aspects related to the dynamic of specific signs reproduced in pots and pipes are similar to body scarifications carried by Africans. It is argued that these decorations were appropriated, recontextualized, and sometimes resignified by Brazilian slaves, who used them in the construction of new diasporic identities."
2012,"The Place of Strategy and the Spaces of Tactics: Structures, Artifacts, and Power Relations on Sugar Plantations of West Brazil","Archaeological research on two sugar plantations of the Chapada dos Guimarães region of West Brazil, the engenhos (sugar mills) of Rio da Casca and Água Fria, has provided an opportunity to study the organization and use of these spaces by planters, free laborers, and slaves. Planters organized the plantations according to a rigidly hierarchical model in which the planter’s house was the central location. They distributed European-produced goods among free laborers and slaves, aiming to reaffirm this hierarchical order. Though the slaves, in turn, had to live within this hierarchical system, they were also able to take advantage of opportunities to subvert this space, using it according to their own practices and traditions. In this sense, they invested the locally produced low-fired earthenware with sign-values and symbols related to their African backgrounds. Thus, two sets of discourses were fitted into the same landscape, composing a dialectic that characterized the multicultural space of the plantations."
2012,Disarticulation of Aónikenk Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways during the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries: Two Case Studies from Argentinean Patagonia,"During the 19th century, stockbreeding in Argentinean Patagonia started to advance over the area occupied by the local indigenous people, ethnographically known as Aónikenk or Tehuelches meridionales, introducing significant changes to their settlement patterns. Institutionally, indigenous peoples were circumscribed into specifically designed reserves. The archaeological record shows that particular individuals chose to marginalize themselves from these changes, both spatially and as a strategy to adapt to the new circumstances brought by the arrival of the stockbreeding community. These strategies are little known, as evidence of them was plunged into an “historical silence.” The analysis of two sites, Puesto Yatel and Puesto Quintillán, provides a wide range of material culture evidence for these processes, including architectural features, chipped-glass technology, metal, wood, lithic technology, and the archaeofaunal record. This new archaeological evidence is crucial for gaining a detailed understanding of 19th- and 20th-century indigenous communities in Patagonia."
2012,Toward Settlement Occupation Span from Dispersion of Tobacco-Pipe Stem-Bore Diameter Values,"Past time is both antiquity and duration, both “when?” and “how long?” Tobacco-pipe stem fragments are a common historical artifact. Harrington histograms and Binford regressions are common dating methods that use pipe stems to answer “when?” questions, regression linking estimated occupation midpoint to mean stem-bore diameter. The value of knowing “how long” justifies the search in three 17th- and 18th-century North American data sets for a relationship between dispersion of stem-bore values (measured by standard deviation) and occupation span. Results further corroborate regression dating, if it needs it, and document qualified but statistically significant correlations between dispersion and occupation span. In the process, they strengthen links between historical and prehistoric archaeology in the science of material culture."
2012,Status and Ceramics in Spanish Colonial Archaeology,"Archaeologists have long used ceramics, especially majolica, as a key indicator of status in the Spanish colonial Americas. In actuality, archaeological evidence for the relationship between status and ceramics varies greatly. Requisitions and invoices (memorias and facturas) from two presidio settlements in Alta California provide valuable information about pricing of ceramic goods and the terminology that colonial officials used to describe them. Analysis of these documents suggests that ceramics were peripheral to Spanish colonial negotiations of status and rank. Some ceramics commonly assumed to indicate high status, such as majolica, are among the least expensive wares shipped to the province. Vessel function appears to have been more important to colonial officials than the ware types or decorative types emphasized by archaeologists. While the findings of this study are specific to Alta California, these results suggest that a broader re-examination of archaeological interpretations of Spanish colonial ceramics may be in order."
2012,Buying Out to Buy In: Ceramic Consumption on the Home Front during the American Revolution in Rural Connecticut,"Between 1993 and 2003, excavations sponsored by the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center unearthed an 18th-century Anglo-American community in North Stonington, Connecticut. This article analyzes the impact of American Revolutionary–period propaganda on consumer behavior among Lake of Isles, Connecticut, residents. Archaeological patterns suggest that the residents participated in boycotts against British goods that the colonies instituted. This article also proposes that “patriots” bought fewer (or no) British imported ceramics during the Revolutionary period, despite their continuing (albeit limited) availability. A variety of historical sources will be analyzed to demonstrate that the people of Lake of Isles embraced patriotic ideals such as military service and persecuting loyalists."
2012,"Ethnicity, Masculinity, and Lineage: The Cultural Biography of a Colonial Massachusetts Parcel of Land","This cultural biography traces the multiple meanings of a large parcel of land in colonial Dunstable, Massachusetts, for members of the Tyng family between the late 17th and the end of the 18th centuries by examining the representation of the land in the documentary record of deeds and probate documents. The land and the deeds employed to transform new territory into a bounded and saleable item were artifacts used in the definition of the Tyngs’ ethnicity (Anglo-American), particularly in the context of 17th-century interactions with the Native Americans. The land was also tied to the expression of independent masculinity and the ability to provide a competence for sons. The role that the land played in the construction of their identities, however, could never be reduced to simply one of these factors since both land ownership and the idea of Englishness and masculinity were tied to concepts of status, family hierarchy, and profession. Finally, an analysis Sarah Tyng’s land transactions at the end of the 18th century demonstrates the ways in which women could also use land to make statements of power and about lineage."
2012,"Textual Artifacts, Artifactual Texts: An Historical Archaeology of Brothertown Writing","Systematic analyses of 18th- and 19th-century texts written by, to, and about the Brothertown Indians demonstrate the merits of experimenting with new approaches to the written word in historical archaeology. Formed from Christian factions of several tribal groups living in coastal northeastern North America, the Brothertown Indian community readily embraced the English language beginning in the second half of the 18th century. As seen in gravemarker inscriptions and historical documents, Brothertown writing practices contain important clues into issues of colonial entanglement, ethnogenesis, and subaltern agency. In uncovering new and insightful perspectives on these processes, methods of textual analysis developed in the context of the Brothertown Archaeology Project demonstrate the merits of deeper engagements with the language of historical texts."
2012,Beyond Reasonable Doubt: A Case for Queen Anne’s Revenge,"Being able to identify an archaeological site is as fundamental to maritime archaeologists as it is to their terrestrial counterparts. Identifying a site allows the archaeologist to utilize the historical record better to answer questions about past lives and events. Often, however, there are no key artifacts or features that positively identify a site. The situation is complicated on high-profile sites where the press, the public, and agencies sponsoring the work want a quick, decisive, and positive pronouncement, while the archaeological profession understands the inherent ambiguity of the archaeological record and wonders how such unambiguous pronouncements can be made on limited data. Rigorous investigation and testing by an interdisciplinary team, such as those focused on the identity of the suspected Queen Anne’s Revenge shipwreck, however, can provide a preponderance of circumstantial evidence that strongly supports the working hypothesis and crosses the threshold of reasonable doubt."
2012,Connecting African Diaspora and West African Historical Archaeologies,"Historical archaeology is a growing and vibrant field of inquiry in West Africa. Since the 1980s, there has been a steady increase in the number studies related to the Atlantic trade and indigenous–European interaction. As the departure point for Africans entering the diaspora, West Africa should be at the forefront of the African Atlantic archaeology, a concept recently championed by A. Ogundiran and T. Falola. Despite the logistical challenges that often inhibit fieldwork, as well as difficulties in communication between Western and African scholars, significant amounts of work have been carried out in West Africa that can inform diaspora and African Atlantic archaeology. By presenting the current state of West African historical archaeology as it relates to common questions and themes within African diaspora studies, the following review serves as a means of initiating an in-depth engagement and discussion among researchers in all related fields and in every region of the Atlantic basin."
2012,A Case of Multiple Identities in La Florida: A Statistical Approach to Nascent Cosmopolitanism,"Within the study of modern cosmopolitanism is the concept that people can have multiple citizenships created through overlapping identities. While this idea of cosmopolitanism differs from Kant’s one-world law, it creates situations where cosmopolitan ideas or nascent cosmopolitanism exist as a result of these multiple identities. Through connections developed from the importation of various goods, such as ceramics, ideas of taste are expanded, which provides opportunities and intensification of access to the global economy for a contested periphery. This article will combine historical and archaeological data to demonstrate the possibility of nascent cosmopolitanism within La Florida at the end of the of the first Spanish period in the 18th century."
2012,"“Minorcan” Ethnogenesis and Foodways in Britain’s Smyrnéa Settlement, Florida, 1766–1777","Established by Dr. Andrew Turnbull, a Scottish physician and entrepreneur, the Smyrnéa settlement was an agricultural enterprise that existed from 1766 to 1777 during the British occupation of Florida. Turnbull recruited approximately 1,100 indentured servants from the Mediterranean island of Minorca along with an additional 300 from Greece, Italy, Corsica, and Turkey. Within the Smyrnéa settlement, the developing cohesion of these various Mediterranean groups over time eventually led to the emergence of a distinctive “Minorcan” cultural community on the Florida frontier. Although common geographic origin, intermarriage, and common religion were major factors contributing to this melding of cultures, the sharing of anxieties and hardships, especially chronic food shortages, also was a significantly strong unifying force. Analysis of the zooarchaeological assemblage from the Turnbull Colonist’s House site, the first residence to be discovered, indicates that British food supplies were insufficient and that the colonists took the initiative in obtaining additional protein by fishing and hunting locally available wild food resources."
2012,"Plazas and Power: Canary Islanders at Galveztown, an Eighteenth-Century Spanish Colonial Outpost in Louisiana","During the late 18th century Spain sent several hundred Canary Islanders (Isleños) to serve as soldiers and settlers in its Louisiana colony. Galveztown, in the Isle d’Orleans, was a planned settlement consisting of a fort and adjacent village. Galveztown was beset by disease, hurricanes, floods, drought, and war. By the 1790s the villagers were described as living in “the most abject want and misery.” In an effort to explain why the Isleños remained at Galveztown as long as they did, the nature of social control in Spanish North America must be understood. In particular, this article examines how Spanish colonial town planning functioned as a form of social control. It is argued that town plazas were the materialization of Spanish efforts to use the cultural landscape as a means of controlling colonial populations. As such, the materiality of the plaza at Galveztown may be reflected in the archaeological record."
2012,A Proposed Model to Investigate the Role of Education in the Success of Military Strategy in Florida during the Second Seminole War (1835–1842),"The Second Seminole War began in Florida in 1835 as a response to increasing hostilities with the Seminole Indians. Various strategies were employed by the United States military, such as relocating the Seminoles onto a reservation within the state of Florida or to a reservation in Oklahoma, but these were largely unsuccessful. One reason for this failure may be traced back to the way the officers of the U.S. Army at that time were educated at West Point Military Academy in New York. West Point had adopted a French-style education system, focusing heavily on engineering, geometry, and philosophy. Florida’s unique swamp-filled landscape was unlike anything previously encountered by the military, however. Effectiveness was also hampered by the fact that much of the interior of the state was unmapped and unexplored. Using GIS and the modern military analysis method of “key terrain, observation and fields of fire, cover and concealment, obstacles, and avenues of approach,” or KOCOA, the interplay between standardized military training and adaptation to a novel environment will be discussed using the Second Seminole War in Florida as a case study."
2012,Reflections of Virginia on the Manatee River,"The Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819 opened Florida as part of the American rapid westward expansion. The new territory offered speculative ventures, potential political careers, and cheap, fertile land to many Tidewater planters. In the 1840s, the newly opened South Florida frontier enabled Middle Florida planters to create sugar plantations, worked by enslaved labor, that participated within the 19th-century global economy. This paper examines the historical sources regarding Robert Gamble’s Virginia heritage, his family’s role in the migration of Virginia planters to Middle Florida, and the creation of the Gamble Plantation in order to gain a sense of the Manatee River frontier as a settlement colony."
2012,Deep Surfaces: Pottery Decoration and Identity in the Mission Period,"In the southeastern United States, many Native American societies invested iconographic meaning in the surface decorations incised or stamped on pottery. While some symbols represented cosmological concepts, others probably designated tribe, village, clan, or other social units. This is certainly true of groups that lived in La Florida, where, at contact, there were clear correlations between some Native American groups and pottery types. During the mission period, however, these associations became blurred. Variability diminished, and three pottery types dominated assemblages of utilitarian wares used by Native Americans and Spaniards. Heretofore, this stylistic turn of events was explained as the result of new allegiances and identities that emerged in the 1600s. It is argued here that, in the Southeast (as elsewhere), the market was responsible for some of this uniformity. Cosmological concepts present in the prehistoric variant of one of these types were retained for some time, however."
2012,Cosmopolitan Meanings of Old Spanish Fields: Historical Archaeology of a Maroon Community in Southwest Florida,"Since 2005, a multidisciplinary public anthropology program has been looking for Angola, an early-19th-century maroon community south of Tampa Bay. Angola provides a link between the beacons of freedom in the northern tier of Florida (Fort Mosé, Prospect Bluff, and the Suwannee settlements) and the later settlements of African Seminoles in the Bahamas and Central Florida. With few documentary resources available, a map is used as an entry point to the lifeways of the maroons of Florida. While labeled Old Spanish Fields, the location represents a place where diverse individuals came together as maroons and interacted with Seminoles, British filibusters, and Cuban fishermen, among others, in the shadow of the Spanish Empire. Their crops indicate the resilience of the peoples who fought for their freedom from slavery. With American rule, the community was devastated, its landscape erased, and the cosmopolitan community unmixed."
2012,Race and the Struggle for a Cosmopolitan Archaeology: Ongoing Controversies over the Representation and the Exhibition of Osceola,"Archaeologists’ growing interest in global manifestations of racialization invite explorations of the subject in cases such as the 19th-century Florida Seminole leader named Osceola. Methodologies that lend themselves to the study of racialized human remains, historical places, material culture, and texts are necessary for the development of archaeological approaches to different forms of available evidence. Ideologies and intellectual discourses are important forces and products of racialization, whose influence is marked in cases like that of Osceola. Theories of racial representation and racialization provide useful methods for deconstructing images, uncovering politicaleconomic interests, and identifying biases of various sources. These are a part of the conceptual toolkit that is necessary for archaeologists to develop a more cosmopolitan practice."
2012,"Creolization in Southwest Florida: Cuban Fishermen and “Spanish Indians,” ca. 1766–1841","Not long after Spanish Florida became United States territory in 1821, the attention of Anglo-American settlers was drawn to the handful of remaining Spanish fishing ranchos along the lower gulf coastline, inhabited by Cuban fishermen and their “Spanish Indian” families and neighbors. The history and identity of these groups, many of whom were forcibly relocated west along with the Seminoles by 1841, has long remained enigmatic due to a paucity of documentation. This paper uses extensive new documentary data from Cuba and Spain to explore the emergence of these new creole communities during Florida’s British and second Spanish periods."
2012,Chipco’s House and the Role of the Individual in Shaping Seminole Indian Cultural Responses to the Modern World,"The use of documentary sources resulting from late-19th-century interactions between Florida Seminole Indians and agents of the U.S. government reveals that individual Seminoles responded to the outside world favorably through the adoption of new technologies, housing styles, and other ways viewed as “progressive” by the government observers. Viewing these individuals as agents of cosmopolitanism allows archaeologists to consider the role of the individual as a source of cultural variation that can be expressed in the archaeological record. A theoretical perspective that sees the individual as a source of creative response provides for a nuanced and complex view of past human behavior; less abstract, and closer to the reality of the human experience. In the Seminole case, styles of house building labeled as desirably progressive are shown to have deeper historical roots and reappear in the late 1800s as a selective response to renewed contact with American society after a period of isolation."
2011,"The Parsonage of the Reverend Willoughby Bean: Church, State, and Frontier Settlement in Nineteenth-Century Colonial Australia","Fieldwork undertaken at the mid-19th-century residence, or “parsonage,” of the Reverend Willoughby Bean in Gippsland, Australia, provides new insight into the impact of the intertwined roles of church and state on the frontier of settlement of 19th-century colonial Australia. The extensive material culture recovered from the Bean site demonstrates a striving towards a status commensurate with Bean’s social standing as the sole local representative of a state church of the governing colonial power. Paradoxically, the very need to maintain materially his social role as a representative of the Anglican Church may have been one of the primary contributors towards the eventual financial failure of the Bean household."
2011,The Archaeology of Mental Illness from the Afflicted and Caretaker Perspective: A Northern California Family’s Odyssey,"Late-19th- and early-20th-century families afflicted with mental illness either took care of their family members or institutionalized them when they were no longer able to provide for them. The effects of mental illness on individuals and their families are explored from the perspective of the Finger/Sengstacken family of San Jose, California. Archaeological investigations of an associated deposit yielded a plethora of grooming- and health-product containers that provide unique insights regarding how the family coped publicly and privately with the challenges of caring for a loved one. The artifacts illustrate the type of life that Tillie, her mother, and aunt shared, and how their life differed from other households at this time. The material culture is paired with research into the practices at the local state institution where Tillie died a decade later."
2011,"Rich Man Poor Man, Pioneer, Thief: Rethinking Earthfast Architecture in New Jersey","Recent archaeological excavations and documentary research have shed light on a once-vibrant and long-lasting tradition of earth fast architecture in New Jersey. This tradition persisted in the state from the period of initial settlement into the 19th century and was utilized by individuals of varied social, economic, ethnic, and occupational backgrounds. Earth fast architecture proved advantageous when masonry building materials were scarce, household economies were meager, skilled masons were expensive, and land tenure was questionable. The use of this architectural technique in New Jersey appears to have reflected a set of phenomena different than that previously identified in the Chesapeake region to the south, and was one of many options available to builders erecting vernacular structures from the 17th into the 19th century."
2011,Native Responses to European Intrusion: Cultural Persistence and Agency among Mission Neophytes in Spanish Colonial Northern California,"Archaeological and ethnohistorical data associated with five northern California Spanish missions are synthesized in order to explore postcontact Ohlone native cultural continuity during the first half century (ca. 1775–1825) of Roman Catholic proselytizing and recruitment. Although the vast majority of native converts occupied a marginal position within Spanish colonial society, it is argued that many of them implemented specific strategies in order to benefit from the mission system while still maintaining a semitraditional cultural orientation. The Franciscan order’s practice of granting seasonal leaves (paseos) to neophytes is viewed as a critical factor that facilitated the retention of an aboriginal worldview amidst the confusion and uncertainty of colonization."
2011,Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Brick-Lined Graves: Their Construction and Chronology,"Graves lined with brick and covered with a brick arch are common in 18th- and 19th-century cemeteries. As yet, they have received scant archaeological attention. During a cemetery restoration project, 38 examples of this type of grave were examined, with half having dated ledger stones (1736–1884) above them. Analysis of the characteristics of these burials provides significant temporal markers. Using these, the burials are grouped into four periods based on date and presence of certain features, providing a model of change in these structures. The validity of the model is then tested by comparison to published descriptions of similar features in the region and over a wide area. This model can be used for the relative dating of brick-lined graves."
2011,"Geological Survey of Historical Cemeteries, Jamestown, Rhode Island, 1693–1900","Studies of historical burial practices may be hindered by the effects of weathering on gravemarkers. A survey of nine historical-period cemeteries on Conanicut Island, Jamestown, Rhode Island, examined the variety of stone types used in gravestone construction between the 17th and 19th centuries. The focus of this study is the date, rock type, and graphic design of the headstone markers, in order to develop a pattern of stone use on the island. The results of the cemetery survey illustrate the shift from slate to marble gravestones during the 19th century. A combination of rock type and design attributes is applied to give rough dates to historical-cemetery headstones that have become illegible due to weathering."
2011,Death and the Dissenter: Group Identity and Stylistic Simplicity as Witnessed in Nineteenth-Century Nonconformist Gravestones,"Until recently British Nonconformist communities have received little attention from archaeologists; however, their monuments and buildings provide a good opportunity to study one of the most important religious identity groups in early modern history. In the 19th century, Methodism was practiced by 25% of the English churchgoing population, and yet it was not until 1880 that its members were allowed to practice their own funerary rites in local churchyards. This study investigates grave monuments found in the private cemeteries attached to Methodist chapels and compares them with the gravestones found in a contemporary planned Victorian cemetery that was divided into Anglican and Nonconformist areas. Before 1880, when funeral expression was limited, simple undecorated monuments were favored, whereas after this date, complex decorated monuments became more common. Within an environment of religious division and intolerance, some Nonconformists, those lucky enough to have access to private burial grounds, chose to express their identity by practicing selective consumerism and through the uniformity found in simple grave monuments."
2011,"Impoverishment, Criminalization, and the Culture of Poverty","This introduction summarizes major new themes raised by articles in this special issue on the archaeology of poverty and processes of impoverishment. First, definitions of poverty are discussed, progressing from simple dictionary definitions to the more complex considerations in articles analyzing the cultural construction of poverty through discourse on impoverishment as a relational process involving fluid power dynamics at the intersections of classes, races, ethnic groups, and genders. Impoverishment is a complex process involving the interaction of capitalism, patriarchy, and racism to produce structurally a set of economic, social, and political positions defined by terms with different meanings. Poverty is culturally constructed through ideological discourse as an individual failing and a stigmatized identity. The historical criminalization of poverty is traced as an important context for the articles. This introduction discusses key ideas brought out in these studies and also offers some historical perspective on the Western construction of poverty and its study by historical archaeologists."
2011,"“We Had It Hard... but We Enjoyed It”: Class, Poverty, and Pride in Baltimore’s Hampden","The Hampden community was established as a paternalist manufacturing village in the mid-19th century in Baltimore’s northern suburbs. Since then, its poor and working-class citizens have struggled for power in a variety of ways. A relational view of the paternalist system posits that power structures are composed of relationships between people, classes, and the means of production. Written statements from the past are important sources of information about class and poverty, but the authors of such statements tend to be from the middle or upper classes. The archaeological record provides another line of evidence for understanding poverty. Artifacts and features from the Mackey site (18BC164) illustrate some of the material strategies that people used to navigate the complex and changing class system at the turn of the 20th century. Understanding these strategies has implications for the contemporary community, which bases many planning decisions on its understanding of Hampden’s past."
2011,Land Rich and Cash Poor: The Materiality of Poverty in Appalachia,"This article considers the materiality of poverty in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia between 1865 and 1920. It problematizes the stereotypes of Appalachia as poor and white, and examines the dialectics in which groups that have power in a social system influence the allocation of different types of resources, such as land. With an emphasis on the landscape, I consider the intersections of poverty, race, and class in the material lives of African American landowners and tenants by comparing material remains as well as access and control of resources."
2011,"Lonely Islands: Culture, Community, and Poverty in Archaeological Perspective","The study of poverty in historical archaeology has not yet developed a productive engagement with the complex political economy of impoverishment. A primary concern with culture and representation has instead supported the production of often essentialized subjects who ultimately mirror the problematic foundations of the “culture of poverty” thesis. This paper critiques the processes of constructing impoverished subjects and considers the notion of a “poverty of culture” as a relational position for analysis. Working in close collaboration with members of an impoverished African American community in Setauket, New York, alternative readings of poverty, culture, heritage, and archaeology are discussed. These alternatives serve as the foundations of a community-driven project informed by indigenous meanings and interests in the archaeological past in order to challenge the marginalization of this part of the broader local community."
2011,Incorrigible Vagabonds and Suspicious Spaces in Nineteenth-Century New Orleans,"Urban archaeological projects routinely incorporate official documents, like census records, probate inventories, and city directories in order to present a nuanced interpretation of the historical material record with a goal of “giving voice” to populations marginalized on the basis of race, ethnicity, class, or other ideas of social difference. By reifying archaeological knowledge around a vision of the city rooted in the stability of documents, however, such projects risk reproducing a dominant narrative of orderly development, itself meant to conceal the contradictions and inequalities associated with the rise of capitalism. An archaeological data recovery at the probable site of a ca. 1840s tavern and boardinghouse located along New Orleans’s riverfront, coupled with a critical reading of census records and newspaper reports of crime and urban disorder, provide opportunities through which the social identity of those existing on the margins of the city may be interrogated."
2011,"When is “Gone” Gone? Archaeology, Gentrification, and Competing Narratives about Freedmen’s Town, Houston","This paper examines the interplay between historic preservation, archaeology, mass media, and competing historical narratives, focusing on one urban community in Texas. After its founding by emancipated African Americans, Freedmen’s Town became the “Mother Ward” for Houston’s growing black professional class. By the late 20th century, due to demographic shifts, a lack of zoning, and weak historic preservation ordinances, it had become one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city (despite being listed on the National Register of Historic Places). The remaining historical structures are now being drowned in a gentrification-driven sea of townhomes and lofts. Some new residents embrace the neighborhood’s history, but others use media and politics to reject it actively, as they enact traditional stereotypes about race, poverty, and class. Within this context, those of us involved with the Community Archaeology Research Institute, Inc., have been attempting to do community-based (not “placed”) archaeology and encourage local-history and public-policy communities to avoid “writing off” the neighborhood as “lost.”"
2011,"To Each a Space: Class, Classification, and Gender in Colonial South Australian Institutions","In South Australia government authorities in a fledging colony were required to build institutions to care for the poor and the pauper insane, and they drew on designs from England, where workhouses and county asylums were being built in response to new laws. From a simple glance at the plans of the Destitute Asylum, which was built to house the deserving poor, and of the Adelaide and Parkside Lunatic asylums, it would appear that gender divisions dominated life in these institutions. A study of the material culture of the asylums, however, indicates a complex range of factors was, in fact, informing the experience of the asylum for the inmates. Gender, classification, social class, and the organizational purpose of the particular institution were all to play a role in determining the access to and use of the space and rooms of the asylums."
2011,Poverty and Progress in the Age of Improvement: Evidence from the Isle of South Uist in the Outer Hebrides,"In 1851, the landlord of the Hebridean islands of South Uist and Barra evicted almost 3,000 people from their homes and transported them by means of assisted passage to Canada. This episode of clearance was prompted by a failure of the potato crop and a four-year-long famine, and exposed the dire state of poverty in which the inhabitants of the islands had been forced to live. This paper draws upon six seasons of fieldwork at Milton and Airigh Mhuillin, in the middle district of South Uist, and argues that historical archaeologists should do more to expose the causes and long-term consequences of poverty. The paper explores the imposition of agrarian capitalism in the Isle of South Uist from the late 18th century, and makes the case that a system of landholding and land use that privileged profit for landowners over the subsistence needs of the mass of the population created a fragile economy that was prone to shortages and completely unable to respond to the challenge of a prolonged famine."
2011,From Goats to Gardens: Feeding Southern Colorado’s Working-Class Poor,"The events of the 1913–1914 southern Colorado coal strike and the cooperative work of the Colorado Coalfield War Archaeology Project provide the opportunity to explore archaeology’s relationship to poverty, hunger, and social justice. This article considers poverty in evidence of worker foodways. I consider what kinds of foods were promoted, what foods were available and from where, what foods were eaten, and how they were prepared. This article includes a comparison of prestrike, strike, and poststrike contexts. In so doing, it reveals the futility of dichotomous categories of deserving and undeserving poor as they relate to a transformative project of working-class poverty. It suggests that the distinction between deserving and undeserving poor has been and continues to be about justifying particular sorts of intervention in people’s lives meant to sustain exploitation of their labor."
2011,Consuming Lines of Difference: The Politics of Wealth and Poverty along the Color Line,"Commentators on African American life have often focused on poverty, evaded recognition of African American wealth, and ignored the ways genteel affluence and impoverishment were constructed along turn-of-the-century color lines. Documentary research and archaeology at the Madam C.J. Walker home in Indianapolis, Indiana, illuminates how the continuum of wealth and poverty was defined and negotiated by one of African America’s wealthiest early-20th-century entrepreneurs. The project provides an opportunity to compare the ways in which wealth was defined and experienced along the color line in the early 20th century, and how such notions of black affluence shaped racialized definitions of poverty and materiality."
2011,Beneath the Surface of Tenement Life: The Dialectics of Race and Poverty during America’s First Gilded Age,"Life during the first Gilded Age in the United States (1865–1925) was a time of considerable social differentiation between rich and poor. Newly arrived immigrants with little money were often relegated to substandard housing in American cities. In this study, I argue that some nonwealthy immigrants were racialized as poor, and I investigate whether this racial categorization created homogeneity in housing and material culture. I use the Five Points district in New York City as my point of investigation, confining my analysis to the late 19th century. My findings are that both tenement housing and artifact possession were generally homogeneous when the analysis is performed at the societal scale."
2011,Florida Archaeology Confronts the Recent Past: Four Case Studies from Tampa,"Human activity of the recent past has resulted in an interpretable archaeological record that can be investigated systematically by archaeologists and serve the interests of people in the present seeking to define and connect with a history relevant to them. In Florida archaeology, academic and cultural resource management environments have not favored the development of archaeological research designs that bring problem-driven stratigraphic approaches to bear on specific deposits dating from the 1880s to the present, therefore, opportunities for a scientifically based public archaeology are being lost. In the young city of Tampa, understanding the depositional processes that contributed to the archaeological record can produce insights into the social, economic, and political forces that shaped the growth of the city into its present form. In particular, deposits resulting from demolition and fill need to be considered as legitimate subjects of archaeological research and understood as the loci for intersecting levels of political relations. Archaeology of the recent past can be immediately attractive to community interests seeking to develop or reinforce heritage identities, and the very act of archaeology can serve these purposes regardless of actual results. In a more traditional role, archaeology can partner with more visible historic preservation efforts to bring a community-based history to local architectural landmarks."
2011,Wharves and Waterfront Retaining Structures as Vernacular Architecture,"This paper examines timber landfill-retaining structures built prior to the mid-19th century in both Europe and North America. It focuses on the timber building traditions in which these wharves, quays, slips, and bulkheads were constructed, viewing them as examples of historical carpentry that fit within a known historical and cultural framework of vernacular construction. These now-buried waterfront structures are increasingly the focus of archaeological investigations. It is argued that a revised approach to documenting and understanding landfill-retaining structures may yield greater insight into the specific cultural influences exercised historically on landmaking and landmaking technology in the New World."
2011,Factors Influencing the Dining Habits of Japanese and Chinese Migrants at a British Columbia Salmon Cannery,"Little archaeological research has focused on comparing the lives of Chinese migrants in North America with their non-Chinese neighbors, and only a modest amount of work of any sort has been done on Japanese sites. The following study compares archaeological and archival evidence of dining habits among Japanese and Chinese laborers at a turn-of-the-20thcentury salmon cannery in British Columbia. The objective is to explore the role of ethnic tradition and contextual factors in patterns of material consumption, using a theoretical perspective rooted in transnationalism and diaspora. Results indicate the Japanese cannery workers consumed a combination of Asian- and Western-style meals, while the Chinese relied largely on traditional meals. Data from these and other sites reveal considerable diversity, however, and demonstrate that labor organization and other contextual factors are at least equally as important as cultural tradition in producing distinctions between consumption patterns of Asian migrant groups."
2011,The Signature of Starvation: A Comparison of Bone Processing at a Chinese Encampment in Montana and the Donner Party Camp in California,Analysis of faunal remains from the historic China Gulch site in western Montana have shed light on behavioral strategies deployed by a marginalized population in a relatively undocumented historical context. China Gulch is a site where Chinese miners set up a temporary shelter after they were ostracized by white miners. Small bone fragments recovered at the site near a hearth suggest that the group underwent nutritional stress. The faunal remains were analyzed for evidence of butchering and processing following methods used to assess the bone recovered at the Donner Party Alder Creek campsite. The China Gulch findings were compared to the processing patterns identified at the Donner site to further support skeletal evidence for a qualitative signature of starvation.
2011,"“… All of Cross”—African Potters, Marks, and Meanings in the Folk Pottery of the Edgefield District, South Carolina","African Americans were integral to the stoneware-manufacturing district that developed around Edgefield, South Carolina. Enslaved African Americans worked as potters at several of the Edgefield shops, and the most renowned potter of the district was an enslaved African American named Dave, who incorporated poetic verse onto some of the pottery he made, as well as other marks including an X and slashes. A cross mark was also associated with two of the potteries in the district where Dave had once worked: the Rev. John Landrum Pottery, and the subsequent operation of this pottery by Rev. Landrum’s son, Benjamin Franklin Landrum. This cross-in-circle mark, known as the Landrum cross, resembles the African Bakongo cosmogram dikenga. The Landrum cross, as well as Dave’s use of the X and slashes, may be representations of African symbols brought to the New World and found archaeologically in other settings and contexts. This paper looks at the African American presence in Edgefield, Landrum crosses, and Dave’s use of the cross mark, to examine the meaning of these marks and their potential expression of African American identity."
2011,"Pursuing Heritage, Engaging Communities","Archaeologists involved in heritage studies and civic engagement movements are working to make a difference in the public lives of communities. They are helping to promote improved quality of life through both political and nonpolitical processes. Meaningful historical awareness coupled with varying kinds and degrees of empowerment can provide a new sense of community building. The articles in this volume provide a variety of approaches that address community, representation, and social-justice issues. They provide strategies for how archaeology can be more engaged in community-heritage building, in some cases providing a sense of place for those who have been forgotten in the dominant narratives."
2011,Collaborative Archaeology and Strategic Essentialism: Native Empowerment in Tidewater Virginia,"How should archaeologists respond to descendant communities whose essentialism runs counter to constructivist notions of identity? For native communities in Virginia, the 17th-century landscape described by Jamestown’s colonists represents a powerful documentary basis for countering discourse that denies or ignores their existence. Strategic essentialism tied to the notion of tribes as transhistorical subjects offers a means of connecting contemporary native communities to accepted national narratives. While such strategies may be necessary in the short term, research at Werowocomoco, capital of the Powhatan chiefdom ca. 1607, highlights other modes of native social construction. Tidewater communities constructed pluralistic networks prior to contact and reconfigured social ties after 1607. They have done so by incorporating new practices while retaining connections to meaningful places and kinship ties stretching across communities. The expanding involvement of native consultants in research at Werowocomoco and elsewhere provides a point of departure for ‘decolonizing’ discussions of this past."
2011,From “Public Archaeologist” to “Public Intellectual”: Seeking Engagement Opportunities Outside Traditional Archaeological Arenas,"Cornel West has said that the role of the intellectual is to try to turn easy answers into critical questions and then put those questions to people with power. To whom do public archaeologists address these questions? I am currently involved in an ongoing experiment to use typically nonarchaeological venues to engage with multiple publics about “history matters.” This includes participation in historical societies, commissions, and committees which may have stated aims to discuss, celebrate, and preserve history, but which frequently (sometimes unconsciously) perpetuate and reproduce traditional race/class inequities and power imbalances. My archaeological focus on inner-city African American neighborhoods in Houston, Texas, means that both my research and this larger project take place in settings where insensitive gentrification is impeding grassroots efforts to maintain and reclaim control of historical landscapes and narratives. This article will examine and critique this work, owning mistakes made and (usually small) victories achieved."
2011,"Archaeologies of Race and Urban Poverty: The Politics of Slumming, Engagement, and the Color Line","For more than a century, social reformers and scholars have examined urban impoverishment and inequalities along the color line and linked “slum life” to African America. An engaged archaeology provides a powerful mechanism to assess how urban-renewal and tenement-reform discourses were used to reproduce color and class inequalities. Such an archaeology should illuminate how comparable ideological distortions are wielded in the contemporary world to reproduce longstanding inequalities. A 20th-century neighborhood in Indianapolis, Indiana, is examined to probe how various contemporary constituencies borrow from, negotiate, and refute long-established urban impoverishment and racial discourses and stake claims to diverse present-day forms of community heritage."
2011,"Archaeology, Intangible Heritage, and the Negotiation of Urban Identity in Lancaster, Pennsylvania","Lancaster, Pennsylvania, has recently experienced a heritage crisis and renewal precipitated by the closing of the Bon Ton, the last downtown department store, and the shuttering of the landmark Watt and Shand Building. Having been the anchor of Penn Square, the city’s physical and social center, the Watt and Shand was perceived by many as a central component of local identity formation, reflecting not only its importance as a manifestation of tangible heritage, but its importance as an arena for the negotiation of the intangible heritage of ritualized consumerism. This article examines the processes of heritage creation and urban renewal by exploring the closing of the Watt and Shand Building, how and why alternative uses of the building were negotiated, and how an alternative heritage narrative emerged through an archaeological investigation of the homes of a radical congressman, Thaddeus Stevens, and his African American associate, Lydia Hamilton Smith."
2011,Displaced and Barely Visible: Archaeology and the Material Culture of Homelessness,"Every night nearly 800,000 people living in the United States are homeless, largely “invisible” to most Americans. Archaeological investigations of the material culture of homelessness in St. Paul and Indianapolis suggest that although causes of homelessness are complex, often related to broader issues of political economy, displaced people still manage to retain a cultural heritage of sorts. They carry some materials with them as part of a nomadic lifestyle, as reminders of “home,” while caching other elements in semipermanent camps, objects that refect their cultural origins. The remainder of their material culture is geared toward shelter and subsistence and is largely disposable. Archaeological perspectives can provide information useful for providing aid to the homeless, especially for assistance outside of homeless shelters."
2011,Cultural Resource Management Archaeology and Heritage Values,"As it moved into the 21st century, the National Park Service embarked on an ambitious program of public involvement and civic engagement explicitly geared to the use of heritage sites to inform the public on contemporary issues. Meanwhile, although Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act mandates the recovery and dissemination of the information recovered from important archaeological sites in the name of public benefit, the contribution of the cultural resource management sector to the public or to civic engagement and education has not achieved its potential. This article explores some of the reasons behind this failure and provides two case studies showing how such an endeavor might work, along with suggestions for the future."
2011,Heritage and “Those People”: Representing Working-Class Interests through Hampden’s Archaeology,"Baltimore’s historically working-class neighborhood of Hampden, like many urban neighborhoods, is contested-heritage terrain. Traditional community members worry about encroaching real-estate development, middle-class hegemony, and economic transformation. Meanwhile, area merchants, developers, and planners (ab)use representations of working-class people’s history to market the area’s real estate, service, and retail economies. Problematic representations of other people’s pasts are often coupled with discourses on progress that simultaneously recall and dismiss workers, casting out “those people’s history” in favor of an empty history of old buildings and facades. The historical archaeology project in Hampden seeks, through community-based practice and aggressive public dissemination of information, to repopulate the neighborhood’s history and reassert the right of its traditional community to possess heritage. The material history of the place is used as a starting point for community engagement with the ultimate goal of countering damaging fantasy representations of the place’s past with realistic ones."
2011,"An Historical Perspective of Civic Engagement and Interpreting Cultural Diversity in Arrow Rock, Missouri","Since 1912, Arrow Rock, Missouri, has transformed itself from a small river town into a major heritage-tourism center through a grassroots historic preservation movement. The result has been that in 1963 Arrow Rock was recorded as a National Historic Landmark site, in 2006 the National Trust for Historic Preservation listed it as one of its “Dozen Distinctive Destination” sites, and in 2008 it was recognized as a “Preserve America Community.” Like many historic towns, Arrow Rock’s preservation and interpretation focused initially on its “white, male, and rich” heritage, ignoring the majority of its past citizens. Beginning in 1996, Arrow Rock has utilized public history and archaeology to develop new interpretive programs that address its African American heritage and that attempt to engage this previously marginalized descendant community."
2011,Civic Engagements in Museum Anthropology: A Prolegomenon for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,"Over the course of the 20th century, advocates and activists have sporadically argued that museums provide an ideal platform for engagements of civic life. Into the 21st century, the social roles and responsibilities of museums are actively being renegotiated, particularly with the blossoming of new collaborative and community-based programs and projects, from local tribally run ecomuseums to the National Museum of the American Indian. Through this case study of work at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science—focusing on two new enterprises, the Collections Synthesis Project and the Indigenous Inclusiveness Initiative—the challenges and opportunities for museum anthropology to contribute to the agenda of civic engagement are examined."
2011,Epilogue: Perspectives on Community Archaeology,"Historical archaeology has promoted dramatic changes in its felds of endeavor over the past quarter century. Theoretical sophistication, international scope, particular attention to the subaltern, and manifold engagement with living stakeholder communities now characterize the profession. This epilogue considers the history of this intellectual progression, interweaving it with consideration of the specifc contributions in this themed volume."
2010,Historical Dendroarchaeology in the EI Malpais Area: Lessons from the Savage Homestead,"The El Malpais National Conservation Area (EMNCA) of west central New Mexico contains dozens of early-20th-century archaeological sites. One site, the Savage homestead (LA 74544), contains evidence of a relatively intensive settlement history in the form of more than 20 structures, roads, fields, and artifacts. The Savage homestead settlement history is investigated through dendrochronological, documentary, archaeological, and oral history data. The assembled data testify to the tenacity and strength of a widow with six children subsisting in the isolation of the high desert of New Mexico and threading her way through the federal paperwork maze to earn a homestead patent—a task accomplished, but an occupation that was short-lived. The social, economic, and environmental contexts of the occupation and abandonment suggest implications for understanding the regional occupation of the area both historically and prehistorically."
2010,"The Archaeology of a Pioneer Family Cemetery in Western Oregon, 1854–1879","A forgotten late-19th-century cemetery (ca. 1854–1879) with 12 graves was discovered in early 2008 during a construction project in western Oregon. Eight graves had been previously opened during a 1901 disinterment, but four remained intact. All provided information on burial patterns during the decades following American settlement of the Willamette Valley by Oregon Trail pioneers. Although the timeline is both slightly delayed and compressed, trends in burial ornamentation and hardware generally follow those noted in American cemeteries in the East. The unadorned graves of the 1850s are most similar to those of earlier decades on the eastern seaboard. By the end of the 1870s, rail lines had been built through the Willamette Valley, and within a few years the valley was linked to a growing national rail network. A relative immediacy of bicoastal contact was achieved at this time, allowing a measure of synchronicity in funerary trends."
2010,The Complexities of Consumption: Eastern Pequot Cultural Economics in Eighteenth-Century New England,"Colonialism shaped economic interactions between Native Americans and settlers, and placed considerable constraints on indigenous people, but Native Americans creatively negotiated these material, economic conditions in practical and cultural ways in their daily lives. By the mid-18th century, Native Americans in New England were deeply entrenched in colonial and market economies as farmhands, domestic workers, whalers, soldiers, craft producers, store customers, and consumers. The Eastern Pequot community of southeastern Connecticut serves as an example which is examined by combining data from three years of excavation of two 18th-century reservation households and the transcribed store ledgers of a local merchant from the middle of that century. Using these dual information sources that sometimes converge and other times relate to different scales or materialities, the study permits a look at the long-term processes and negotiations of colonial market economies through the lens of consumption and cultural economics."
2010,Elixir of Emigration: Soda Water and the Making of Irish Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City,"Archaeologists at a few sites in the United States have uncovered numerous soda-water bottles in features associated with the dwellings of 19th-century Irish immigrants. This study focuses particularly on findings from the Five Points, New York City’s most notorious 19th-century working-class neighborhood, and offers explanations for what may potentially be a more widespread pattern of soda-water usage among Irish immigrants. Based on information gathered from historical and folkloric archives and attention to the materiality of soda water, it is argued that soda water resonated with Irish immigrants, evoking varied Irish traditional understandings of water, and offering new possibilities to address new Irish concerns in the U.S. By purchasing, selling, and consuming soda water, Irish immigrants managed issues including health, nostalgia, temperance, Irish nationalism, status, and identity. Soda water acted as a fluid substance providing relief for sickness and homesickness, and facilitated the creation of new Irish American identities."
2010,Feminist Theoretical Perspectives on the Archaeology of Poverty: Gendering Institutional Lifeways in the Northeastern United States from the Eighteenth Century through the Nineteenth Century,"A multifaceted feminist theoretical framework provides insights into relationships between patriarchal Western gender ideology and the materialization of ideology and methods for addressing poverty in institutions in the northeastern United States. This research found that institutions for the poor were instrumental in reinforcing social structures of gender inequality. The author’s feminist framework of a heterarchy of powers leads to an analysis of institutional male supervisory powers, used to enforce inmate performance of work rituals that inscribed their bodies with normative insignia of gender. The framework also reveals evidence of muted voices of inmates and their gendered social agency in resisting incarceration. Finally, some archaeological and documentary evidence indicated ways that supervisors used “powers with” inmates. Excavations provided data not available in documents concerning the extent to which ideal practices for reforming inmates were followed, as well as undocumented foodstuffs and medicines, both usually served by women."
2010,"New World with a New Sky: Climatic Variability, Environmental Expectations, and the Historical Period Colonization of Eastern North America","Colonists arriving in eastern North America at the start of the historical period faced not only new topographies and new plant and animal communities, but also new climatic regimes. The transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age several centuries earlier presented Viking settlers in the North Atlantic region with the task of learning that their new environments were more fragile and changed more rapidly than the familiar forms of those environments suggested at the outset of colonization. North American colonists arriving from England expected different environments, but also expected them to vary consistently according to latitude. Examination of these two examples of colonization using the landscape learning model, particularly the concept of limitational knowledge, shows clear time gaps between practical and archaeologically identifiable adjustments to local climatic conditions and updating of the wider social understanding of the regional environments."
2010,"Environmental Archaeology and Landscape Transformation at the Seventeenth-Century Ferryland Site, Newfoundland","From the 16th century onwards, English, Bretons, Basques, and Portuguese exploited the rich cod stocks of Newfoundland’s Grand Banks. Several permanent settlements in eastern Newfoundland were begun in the early 17th century, including the settlement at Ferryland (1621-1696). Planter families at Ferryland fished and welcomed seasonal fishing fleets, participating in a trade network that included the West Indies, New England, the Iberian Peninsula, the Mediterranean, and Great Britain. The colonization process brought about changes to the local environment due to both the intentional and unintentional importation of European plants and animals. The presence of a substantial percentage of nonnative plants and insects suggests that ballast dumping as well as the establishment of small cottage gardens contributed to the introduction of several species to Newfoundland. Data from archaeobotanical, archaeoentomological, and faunal analyses can be used to examine processes of biological transfer, landscape change, and development of local household economies of Ferryland residents."
2010,"Labor and Agricultural Production at Sylvester Manor Plantation, Shelter Island, New York","Archaeological and historical research on Sylvester Manor, Shelter Island, New York, provides insight into the productive strategies and labor organization of a northern agricultural plantation. Between 1652 and 1693, Sylvester Manor produced and shipped food, animals, and other provisions to a sugar plantation on Barbados. This New York plantation was a commercial-scale operation, based on the labor of enslaved Africans and free Native Americans. Plant and animal remains recovered from the archaeological excavations at the site provide evidence of the plantation’s products and insights into the various daily agricultural tasks that comprised the work of the plantation. The choice of crops and animals, seasonal agricultural cycles, cultural and gendered conceptions of labor tasks, and the power dynamics inherent in multicultural plantation settings all structured the agricultural work of the plantation."
2010,Fueling the Fire: Examining Caribbean Colonial Relations Between Humans and the Environment,"Subtle socioeconomic and cultural circumstances mitigated decisions on resource exploitation made by participants in the Caribbean sugar industry. Local and global influences are here explored for two sets of individuals: plantation owners and enslaved workers. These forces set the backdrop for investigating relationships between humans and the environment. Discussions of archaeobotanical evidence, historical documents, material culture, and architectural features illustrate how fuel sources used at the Coconut Walk estate on the island of Nevis between 1750 and 1810 are indicative of these dynamic relationships. Examination of interrelationships through the comparison of fuel sources from four distinct plantation activities provides a narrative about the plantation owner and workers, and their attitudes toward the environment, economics, and plantation society."
2010,Alta California Missions and the Pre-1849 Transformation of Coastal Lands,"Beginning in the late 18th century, Spanish and Mexican colonization introduced the system of missionization into what is today described as Alta California. Missionaries and soldiers, using native labor, directed the construction of 21 missions along the Alta California coast. The mission complexes—churches, quadrangles, and outlying buildings and structures—were intended to bring about a new order on the native landscape by means of the introduction of European-style architecture, agriculture, and animal husbandry. This introduction began the ecological transformation of the landscape. European plants and weeds came to dominate coastal California well before the California Gold Rush occurred in 1849. This transformation had an immeasurable impact on the local environment, and on the daily life of the native Californians who lived in the missions."
2010,Caribou to Cod: Moravian Missionary Influence on Inuit Subsistence Strategies,"German Moravian missionaries arrived in Labrador, Canada at the end of the 18th century. They intended to introduce Christianity to Inuit peoples without disrupting important aspects of traditional Inuit culture, such as hunting practices. Over time the Moravians began introducing more than just religion: European raw materials, manufactured products, and foods. As a result, Inuit were incorporated into a market economy in which the export of local goods produced by Inuit labor such as seal oil, dried fish, ivory, and fur were exchanged for iron tools, guns, cloth, and ceramics. Simultaneously, becoming part of a larger global economy meant changing aspects of the local subsistence economy. Inuit subsistence strategies were incorporated into a Moravian economic strategy, and ecological relationships changed as a result of colonial influences. Integration into a market economy also altered the spiritual intersection between Inuit and animals."
2010,Tectonics of a Virginia Castle: Environmental Archaeology at Alexander Spotswood’s Mansion at Germanna,"Archaeological investigations at Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood’s Enchanted Castle at Germanna (Orange County, Virginia) exposed the remains of a very large, elaborately designed, and ornately decorated mansion. The complex was constructed using mostly stone (schist, slate, sandstone, and marble) and brick. Where did these materials come from, and what kind of technology or skill was required for their use? The building process and manipulation of local materials showcased Spotswood’s knowledge and control of the natural world, and also prompt researchers to consider new hypotheses on colonial agency on the Virginia frontier."
2010,Reading the Rings: Decoding Iconographic (“Jesuit”) Rings,Analysis of designs on iconographic rings has been hampered by a lack of information on sources in France for the rings themselves and limited contexts within which to interpret them. An examination of French rings and the possible meanings of designs in France open up new ways of thinking about the rings as tools for chronological analysis.
2010,Outfitting the Pepper Wreck,"This article is part of a series of papers on the attempts to reconstruct and understand an early-17th-century Portuguese Indiaman based on the archaeological remains of the presumed Nossa Senhora dos Mártires, a Portuguese nau that sank at the mouth of the Tagus River, Portugal, in September 1606. With the help of 3-D computer software, the authors try to understand how the interior space of this ship was used and occupied, and propose a plausible size, weight, and configuration for the cargo storage, which will be tested in terms of the fully loaded ship’s intact stability. The result is intended as a theoretical model of a ca. 1600 Portuguese nau. Only further archaeological probing will tell whether it is an accurate model or not."
2010,Butchers and Shamans: Zooarchaeology at a Central Mexican Hacienda,"Zooarchaeological analysis conducted on remains recovered during two seasons of excavations at the Hacienda San Miguel Acocotla illuminates patterns of consumption among indigenous workers during the 19th century. Ethnographic research among modern butchers and at markets in Puebla, Cholula, and Atlixco, Mexico informs and contextualizes the results. When compared with data drawn from faunal remains on plantations in the United States, the results suggest that class analysis is of central importance to understandings of social dynamics of multiethnic sites throughout the Americas. In spite of this, some remains hint at the maintenance of pre-Columbian religious practices on the hacienda in the 19th century, suggesting that ethnicity was also salient to the inhabitants of the workers’ quarters at Acocotla."
2010,"Incumbents and Challengers: Indigenous Politics and the Adoption of Spanish Material Culture in Colonial Xaltocan, Mexico","Historical documents record instances in the 16th and 17th centuries in which elites from Xaltocan, an indigenous town in the northern Basin of Mexico, requested permission to wear Spanish clothes, carry swords, and ride horses. Spanish artifacts, especially tin-enameled serving vessels known as majolica, are found scattered in peripheral contexts in Xaltocan, but they are not associated with the main plaza or indigenous elite areas around the plaza. Combined, these data suggest that at least two groups of indigenous people adopted Spanish material culture with different goals and strategies in mind: upper elites who marked their bodies with the insignia of power (Spanish dress and weaponry), and lower elites or commoners who adopted Spanish ceramics in feasts for display that could help them subvert structures of power and move up in the social hierarchy."
2010,Rethinking Mission Land Use and the Archaeological Record in California: An Example from Santa Clara,"Previous archaeology at California’s missions has primarily focused on structures and the areas immediately adjacent to structures. Study of the documentary record tends to concentrate on annual reports (informes) and communication between mission fathers, with some attention paid to buildings and structures shown on historic maps. Recent construction activities on the Santa Clara University campus have triggered archaeological planning and research, and have shown the importance of open-area excavation for understanding land use between and among structures of Mission Santa Clara, as well as in more outlying areas. Focus on areas between buildings increases the likelihood of finding more ephemeral living and usage areas. Complementary study of historic drawings and descriptions also demonstrates that Native Americans used lands between and surrounding structures for living, agricultural, and foodprocessing areas."
2010,"Industry, Entrepreneurship, and Patronage: Lewis Wernwag and the Development of Virginius Island","In the 19th century, Virginius Island developed as a center for craft, industry, and service facilities that supported the United States Armory complex at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. The earliest phase of development in this community is represented at one tract of land that is associated with the family of engineer and entrepreneur Lewis Wernwag. Wernwag was an inventor, bridge builder, and machinist. A landscape and archaeological analysis shows the contradictions of living in a community transitioning to an industrial capitalist economy. While the landscape that Wernwag created reflects the traditional craft ethos—one that does not reinforce the separations of domestic and work life—the family’s household assemblage shows that they did participate in modern consumerism and they reinforced separations around the table and between groups. An analysis of the Wernwags’ property and assemblage shows how this family embraced emerging technological rationalities through material things."
2010,"The Fighting Irish: Historical Archaeology of Nineteenth-Century Catholic Immigrant Experiences in South Bend, Indiana","Father Edward Sorin purchased land south of the University of Notre Dame in north central Indiana in the 1850s and created a residential neighborhood for Catholic immigrants, many of whom were Irish. The university’s 2007 archaeological field school began investigating the homelots that comprised this immigrant enclave, known as Sorinsville. Specifically, this study seeks to understand how affiliation with the university shaped use of the spatial and material worlds of late-19th- and early-20th-century Irish immigrants to the city. The archaeological and historical evidence from South Bend illuminates a complex picture that suggests Irish immigrants experienced both alienation from, and incorporation into their new social and cultural milieus. For the immigrants south of Notre Dame’s campus, being Catholic was as important to their identities and lived experiences as being Irish."
2010,Remembering New Philadelphia,"New Philadelphia was located in western Illinois about 25 miles east of the Mississippi River, and developed as a small multiracial and rural community from 1836 onward. It is the earliest known town in the United States to have been planned and legally founded by a free African American. Remnants of this town, which was founded by Frank McWorter, survived into the 20th century. From 2004 to 2006, a collaborative research project and summer field schools in archaeology, supported by the National Science Foundation’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, helped to explore several lots throughout the town site that once belonged to residents of both European American and African American descent. Analysis of landscapes, archaeology, and the documentary record has helped to develop a more comprehensive picture of life in a rural frontier community and past dynamics of class, gender, ethnicity, and racism."
2010,New Philadelphia Pedestrian Survey: Phase I Investigations at an Historic Town Site,"The authors directed an initial archaeological survey of the New Philadelphia town site in 2002 to 2003. This pedestrian survey and related database work using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) computer software yielded detailed distribution maps of over 7,000 artifacts, and identified a large concentration of artifacts within the north-central part of the town site. These artifacts consisted mostly of nails, ceramics, and bottle glass, indicating that many of the town lots served primarily domestic and residential purposes, rather than craft or industrial functions. Material remains of some of the town’s businesses, such as a blacksmith operation, were also present. The methods used in this Phase I project, which combined basic pedestrian surveying techniques with sophisticated database and mapping programs, provided a highly valuable baseline for designing and undertaking later geophysical surveys and full excavations of residential and business locations within the town site."
2010,"Geophysical Detection of Features and Community Plan at New Philadelphia, Illinois","Geophysical surveys, including magnetic field gradient and electrical resistance techniques, were conducted at New Philadelphia to identify productive locations for excavation, investigate the community plan, and present students with training in these techniques. Excavation of a sample of the most promising anomalies identified foundations, stone-lined and pit cellars, wells, a privy, and other features. Archival records available during the fieldwork provided no evidence for the presence of four features constructed in the 1840s and 1850s. Features directly associated with houses, such as foundations and cellars, are located very near the platted locations of streets, alleys, and corners, whereas many of the non-residential features occur in the middle portions of lots."
2010,Identity and Collective Action in a Multiracial Community,"Social identities are often fluid, dynamic, and impacted by issues related to race, class, gender, and ethnicity. The research project at New Philadelphia, Illinois has uncovered archaeological assemblages related to households classified by census takers as black, mulatto, and white, which included different genders and age groups, and residents who came from different regions in the United States, or from overseas. An examination of the material culture from a sample of households in this demographically integrated community indicates that they had ready access to a broad diversity of American-made and imported household goods. Little variation existed among households when comparing these consumer goods. The homogeneity of consumer goods from African American and European American households in this community may have reflected a shared group consciousness within a local social network that existed in a region shaped by racial hostilities and strife."
2010,Agriculture and Regionalism at New Philadelphia,"A study of agricultural practices around New Philadelphia, Illinois, and a comparison of these practices with those in the regions from whence the New Philadelphia residents came, tests the definitions of Upland South, Midland, and Northern (or Yankee) subsistence traditions. Using data from the U.S. census reports and agriculture schedules from 1840 and 1850, the choices of crops and livestock made by farmers in New York, Ohio, and Kentucky are compared to those made in the New Philadelphia community. Regional differences are found to have existed which influenced the farmers who lived in the area of that town in western Illinois. This study provides a firmer understanding of the subsistence and economic practices of the community."
2010,"Courtly, Careful, Thrifty: Subsistence and Regional Origin at New Philadelphia","Three years of research at the New Philadelphia site in western Illinois have provided the opportunity to integrate archaeological and documentary information to improve the understanding of family organization, economic patterns, and subsistence activities in this small, racially integrated, agrarian community. Analysis of the faunal remains recovered, and the study of available historical records, permit one to compare and contrast households within the town site, and to explore how the different regional backgrounds of the town’s residents affected their livelihoods. Patterns of migration, regional origin, social organization, and intricate familial relationships are continuing to emerge even as new data are being collected. Because of its small size and its discrete and relatively recent existence, New Philadelphia presents a unique opportunity to study the entire history of a community in minute detail."
2010,Voices of New Philadelphia: Memories and Stories of the People and Place,"A project of collecting and recording oral histories related to New Philadelphia provided a valuable avenue for understanding facets of racism, and played an integral role in establishing a community-based archaeology program that emphasizes civic engagement. These oral histories also provided details of the historical context of the town, and revealed information that aided archaeological investigations. Several interviews supplied valuable data concerning the likely locations of structures, residences, and businesses that once existed within the town site. Oral histories further contributed data for meeting the challenges of analyzing cultural, ethnic, and class differences in artifact assemblages recovered from each house lot."
2010,Education and Gender in New Philadelphia,"Education plays a vital role in any society, providing a process by which young community members are enculturated. New Philadelphia included two segregated schools until approximately 1874, when an integrated schoolhouse was constructed nearby. Historical documents and oral histories provide guides to archaeological investigations of those structures, and a likely foundation stone of one school was located in excavations, as were artifacts related to educational activities. Institutional education in 19th-century America can be understood as assigning value to specific knowledge, behaviors, and beliefs. Before public education became mandatory, parents were given choices as to how their children would be educated, and which of their offspring they could afford to send to school. Education is examined in New Philadelphia through a study utilizing U.S. census data, and is an ideal subject for an analysis of race, gender, and class dynamics."
2010,"Separated by Death and Color: The African American Cemetery of New Philadelphia, Illinois","Residents of New Philadelphia utilized two cemeteries, one which served primarily African American families, and one which served mostly European Americans. Details of grave markers and material culture remains in the cemetery that served African American residents of the town, including members of the McWorter family, were recorded, researched, and analyzed. This study reveals connections between several material items recorded in that cemetery, and the continuing development of particular commemoration traditions related to West African cultures. Broken vessels and animal bones distributed on grave sites, and trees growing in and around the cemetery in a seemingly random fashion, may appear to a casual observer as evidence of a graveyard unkempt. In fact, such placements were often intentional, and involved particular spiritual and symbolic meanings."
2010,"Damaging Detours: Routes, Racism, and New Philadelphia","The 19th-century impacts of racism and transportation developments on New Philadelphia, Illinois are explored by examining oral history, documentary, and archaeological evidence. This study first addresses the region in which New Philadelphia was located, outlining the contours of a landscape torn by racial strife. Analysis of the history of the construction of a regional railroad that bypassed New Philadelphia is then provided. Evidence shows that the town was bypassed for reasons other than competition from other potential depot towns, engineering concerns with topography, or other rational business reasons. The impacts of aversive racism very likely diverted the railroad route around New Philadelphia, spelling its demise. Finally, the lessons that emerge from these past social, economic, and racial dynamics are considered."
2010,Conditions of Subject and Object,"This collection of articles concerning archaeological and historical investigations of New Philadelphia concludes with a commentary that discusses the heritage of Frank and Lucy McWorter and the town, and the challenges of such research endeavors from the perspective of a descendant and a scholar of Black agency and African American history. Like many other McWorter descendants, Abdul Alkalimat sees such an archaeological project as a way to promote, preserve, and further explore the story of that founding family and the town. The role of such research projects in expanding the base of support and knowledge is highly valuable. The legacy of freedom, a powerful story rooted in the history of Frank and Lucy McWorter, provides a profound and important message within American history."
2009,Locally-made or Imported? Identifying Ceramic Composition Variation in the San Francisco Presidio Jurisdiction,"In the late 18th century, representatives of the Spanish empire occupied the San Francisco Bay Area and rapidly transformed the region through the introduction of agriculture, animal husbandry, Roman Catholicism, the Spanish language, and the use of pottery. This paper focuses on the latter, evaluating questions of local manufacture or importation of ceramic materials among missions, the presidio, and pueblos within the San Francisco Presidio Jurisdiction. Through the application of instrumental neutron activation analysis of ceramic materials, local production of earthenwares at each of the missions is shown whereas glazed ware patterns reveal a mix of local and nonlocal sources. These patterns provide insights into the manufacture, supply, and exchange of ceramics in the San Francisco Bay Area, and through them a window on the materiality of the colonial encounter."
2009,"The Afro-Caribbean Ware from the Brimstone Hill Fortress, St. Kitts, West Indies: A Study in Ceramic Production","The free and enslaved Africans who lived and worked at the Brimstone Hill Fortress in the 18th and 19th centuries were part of a multiethnic community within the dominant British colonial military culture, which sought to oppress expressions of individuality and cultural identity. The Afro-Caribbean ware from Brimstone Hill is compared to similar wares from nearby islands based on a set of quantitative and qualitative traits. Macroscopic analysis and results from Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of a sample of Brimstone Hill Afro-Caribbean ware indicates that the Afro-Caribbean from Brimstone Hill was produced on St. Kitts. The role of pottery production in the strategies employed by free and enslaved Africans to cope with the various risks facing marginalized and disenfranchised populations is discussed."
2009,"A Historic Dugout from the Apalachicola River, Florida","During May of 2006, loggers removed a large logboat from the Apalachicola River, in Franklin County, Florida. Investigation revealed the vessel to be carved from a single cypress (Taxodium sp.) tree and measuring over 50 feet in length; one of the longest dugout craft known in Florida. Based on the rectilinear and angular shape, evidence for fabrication with metal-edged tools, and radiometric radiocarbon analysis, the craft appears to be a 19th-century colonial canoe hybrid, designed for the transport of cargo. Now designated 8Fr961 in the Florida Master Site File, it is unlike any other on record in Florida and its study has provided a unique opportunity to contribute to the growing body of information regarding Florida’s historic watercraft."
2009,Testing the Effectiveness of Ground-Penetrating Radar at Three Dragoon Forts in Iowa and Wisconsin,"Dragoon fortifications of the 1830s through the 1850s are some of the most important historic sites of the Midwest, built for the supervision of the removal of Indians and the arrival of European American settlers. Ground-penetrating radar (Gpr) surveys at three dragoon forts demonstrate that Gpr varies greatly in its ability to detect fort-era features. The forts surveyed were Fort Atkinson in Iowa, Second Fort Crawford in Wisconsin, and Fort Des Moines No. 2 in Iowa. Fort Atkinson contained numerous early historic features detected by extensive Gpr survey and confirmed by excavation. A Gpr survey at Second Fort Crawford revealed features that correspond well with an historic map of the fort. Extensive Gpr survey of Fort Des Moines determined there is little correspondence between expected fort structure locations and Gpr features; archaeological excavation revealed that fort-era deposits are very ephemeral and buried beneath deep layers of later historic fill. Based on these tests, Gpr appears to be well suited for survey of substantial military fortifications, provided the site has not been extensively disturbed or covered by dense layers of later fill."
2009,"Conflict and Commerce: Maritime Archaeological Site Distribution as Cultural Change on the Roanoke River, North Carolina","For centuries, the transportation provided by the Roanoke River, North Carolina, has played a vital role in the economic and military history of the area. The Civil War illustrated the importance of the waterway as a military consideration, when both the Union and the Confederacy strove to control the river. The conflict inflicted grievous harm upon the region’s maritime transportation. Taken as a whole, the shipwrecks and abandoned vessels of the river provide an exceptional vantage point regarding questions of technology and economy, both in times of peace and when these tranquil periods are juxtaposed against warfare and upheaval. This research uses statistical and geo-spatial analyses of the shipwrecks and abandoned vessels of the Roanoke River in an attempt to discern anthropological patterns. Both historical and archaeological data are the subject of investigation. Three major themes: manner of loss, trade, and technology, are explored primarily to interpret how cultural change is reflected in the assemblage of shipwrecked and abandoned vessels of the waterway. The trends that emerge are often interwoven among these themes, and through them, this paper attempts to explain such diverse phenomena as shifting trade patterns, wreck clustering, vessel dimensions, and the dichotomy of behavior between times of war and times of peace."
2009,Chinookan Survival and Persistence on the Lower Columbia: The View from the Kathlamet Village,"Prominently mentioned in the Lewis and Clark journals, the Kathlamet were devastated by infectious diseases and gradually lost their identity as a distinct, local Chinookan group in the historical record. In part because of the alleged abandonment of the Kathlamet village about 1810, the Kathlamet were subsumed under the Lower Chinook in the principal ethnographic account of the Chinookan peoples around the mouth of the Columbia River. Archaeological evidence from the Kathlamet village, as well as historical records, contradicts the alleged date of abandonment, and indicates that occupation of this settlement actually persisted into the mid-19th century. The use of material culture and historical records to examine the Kathlamet’s post-contact experience helps reestablish their cultural identity for this time period, and reasserts their position as one of the more important of the many local groups of Chinookan peoples in the Lower Columbia Valley."
2009,"Imagining the Moravian Mission: Space and Surveillance at the Former Ebenezer Mission, Victoria, Southeastern Australia","Colonization of Australia was shaped by a culturally specific, imagined geography that entailed a precise conception of what the indigenous landscape and its people were to become. In establishing a system of Aboriginal reserves in the southeastern colony of Victoria around 1860, this European worldview was expressed in the creation of didactic landscapes, designed to teach Aboriginal residents how to live like white people. Archaeological investigation of the former Ebenezer Mission, in northwestern Victoria, demonstrates how Moravian missionaries sought to establish a paternalistic relationship with the indigenous people, expressed through spatio-visual organization and embodied practices. This program was successfully inaugurated, as indicated by evidence for the settlement’s landscaping and for the function of the mission-house, especially in its role as hub and contact place, its central and commanding position, its regular extension and rebuilding, and the operation of European systems of domesticity within it. The missionaries’ apparent success in controlling aspects of mission-house operation must be viewed, however, in the context of the uncertainties and difficulties their evangelical program encountered as well as of Aboriginal strategies of mobility and evasion that undermined the spatial apparatus of the reserves."
2009,"Using Geodatabases to Generate “Living Documents” for Archaeology: A Case Study from the Otago Goldfields, New Zealand","Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are still growing in relation to historical archaeology, and the related literature contains little on the actual methods for structuring such data. The author draws on fieldwork at four sites in the Otago Region of New Zealand to present a sample data model as well as various uses for GIS in historical archaeology—from initial data collection to public presentation. Methodology developed here was used to map surface remains with GPS at four gold mining sites. Because unforeseen problems can arise when transitioning field data into digital formats, the process developed as part of the author’s work to translate, organize, and disseminate data is presented in clear steps. The benefits for public consumption of archaeological material is discussed as well as the potential for GIS to address simple phenemonelogical questions about past decisions in regards to site placement."
2009,Children in Paradise: Growing Up on the Australian Goldfields,"Paradise, a gold mining town in Queensland, Australia, was occupied only briefly towards the end of the 19th century, a single fleeting moment in the boom-and-bust cycle of the Australian gold rush. At its zenith, Paradise was home to more than 600 people, and contrary to popular expectations about the nature of the goldfields, a substantial proportion of the inhabitants were children. While the presence of children in the archaeological record is frequently overlooked, evidence from Paradise not only confirms the existence of children at the site but also illuminates community attitudes toward children and the nature of childhood in colonial Australia. The evidence from Paradise strongly suggests a deep-rooted tension between middle-class Victorian ideals of childrearing and the realities of life in a frontier mining town."
2009,"The Ideology of Domesticity and the Working-Class Women and Children of Port Adelaide, 1840–1890","In discussing the acceptance of the ideology of domesticity by the working class of Australia, Grace Karskens (2001:79) has suggested that archaeologists need to “consider the limits of domesticity and moral order in some houses, in some lives.” Three sites in Port Adelaide are examined in response to this suggestion: the McKay and Farrow family cottages, and a group of four tenanted cottages. The artifacts from these sites were used to determine the extent to which the ideology of domesticity had been accepted by the residents, particularly in relation to the economic role of women and children and the idea of home as a sanctuary. This is analyzed by considering the archaeological evidence for women undertaking paid work within the home, the number of children’s toys, and evidence of home decoration in the form of ornaments and house fittings. This evidence would suggest the McKay family had fully embraced the ideology of domesticity, while the Farrow family incorporated a working wife into their conception of respectability. For the residents at Quebec Street, however, adherence to the ideology was a daily struggle that required sacrifices."
2009,"A Changed Landscape: Horticulture and Gardening in the Adelaide Hills Face Zone, South Australia, 1836–1890","The Adelaide Hills Face Zone Cultural Heritage Project examined landscape use in an area of the Adelaide Hills of South Australia following European colonization. Protected by legislation that controlled development and agriculture in the area, the Hills Face Zone preserved a relict colonial landscape where a diversity of archaeological sites remained. A range of activities that had transformed the natural environment and created this new landscape were identified, including the creation of home and market gardens, experimental horticultural activities, and the establishment of plant nurseries. Because the knowledge and experiences brought by the colonists from England were of limited use in this new environment, cultural adaptation and innovation played an important part in the transformation of the landscape."
2009,Lake Innes: Identifying Socioeconomic Status in the Archaeological Record,"Lake Innes Estate, near Port Macquarie, New South Wales, flourished in the 1830s, declined during the 1840s, and faded away during the late-19th century. In its heyday, its viability was based on the labor of assigned servants who were not free, that is to say transported convicts, but paid free workers were also employed. There was a complex social hierarchy, at the top of which were the residents of Lake Innes House: family members of Major Innes, a retired British army officer. The documentary record for Lake Innes is extensive, but so is the archaeological record. The remains and sites of domestic buildings display differences that reflect the social order of the estate, in which even the servants were divided into several classes. Artifact assemblages provide a similar picture. Small items subject to accidental loss rather than discard are particularly informative, such as coins, buttons, dressmaking pins, and fragments of smoking pipes."
2009,Shipwreck Cargoes: Approaches to Material Culture in Australian Maritime Archaeology,"What has been learned from the detailed study of cargo material found on merchant shipwreck sites in Australia? Some extensive collections of shipwreck cargo material have resulted from archaeological excavations by maritime archaeologists over the past 30 years or so. Other collections have been created by SC UBA divers, primarily before the introduction of the Commonwealth (Federal) Historic Shipwrecks Act in 1976. Many of these have now been documented as a result of the 1993 amnesty. The relationship between cargo artifacts from archaeologically excavated shipwrecks and similar artifacts found on terrestrial historical archaeological sites is explored through a consideration of the meanings attached to these objects, suggesting ways that artifact studies focused on shipwreck cargo material can contribute to understandings of colonial societies, the nature of capitalism, and the rise of consumerism. It is argued that successful colonial settlement was only possible where there was a regular supply of suitable consumer goods for the newly arrived colonists."
2009,"From Stain to Saint: Ancestry, Archaeology, and Agendas in Tasmania’s Convict Heritage—A View from Port Arthur","Thirty years of archaeology at Australia’s best-known penal colony, Port Arthur, has spanned the national (1988) and Tasmanian state (2004) bicentenaries. During that period, many Australian archaeological questions and methodologies have remained consistent, while the character of Australian society and popular understandings and uses of its convict beginnings have altered dramatically. One of the most radical shifts felt at Port Arthur stems from a growing public desire for an imagined experience of belonging and nationhood that has the potential to displace evidence-based considerations in the management of Tasmania’s convict places. Current archaeology at the Port Arthur Historic Site has the potential to shed significant light on aspects of convict experience and the processes of colonization; however, the validity of this research is increasingly being challenged by the politics of heritage and national myth making in constructing imaginary white colonial pasts. The recent emergence of the convict national element in Australian postcolonial identity is discussed along with queries about the future role of archaeological research at Port Arthur within the context of changing popular attitudes to convict heritage."
2009,Sourcing Gunflints to Their Country of Manufacture,"Some 318 gunflints recently recovered from the French barque longue, La Belle, which ran aground off the coast of Texas in 1686, and an additional 405 gunflints from the related terrestrial site of Fort St. Louis offer an opportunity to research the origins of gunflints found in the colonial period Americas. Current research suggests that the best means of addressing this question is through inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), comparing traceelement chemical levels in European source materials with trace-element levels in gunflints found in the New World. A small number of samples from colonial sites and European source locations were submitted to evaluate the potential of this application for sourcing chert. While the initial results are encouraging, some caution is warranted."
2009,Rim Codes: A Pacific Coast Dating System for Milk Bottles,"Milk bottles from the western United States sometimes exhibit embossed numbers on the upper surface of the finish. Physical and historical evidence indicate that these numbers constitute a unique date code, indicating the month and year of production. Examination of more than 1,200 milk bottles from this region (227 with the code) demonstrates that the code was used by five California glass factories between 1924 and 1933. It appears that in a region with intense competition among glass factories, this dating system was developed to help dairies track bottle loss—a significant problem at that time. The code was discontinued after most of the region’s milk bottle production was concentrated in a single company."
2009,Bricks and Mortar: A Method for Identifying Construction Phases in Multistage Structures,"An inexpensive and simple method for identifying individual construction and renovation phases in stone and brick buildings that have evolved over many decades is outlined in reference to an Australian case study. Mortar samples are placed in 10% hydrochloric acid and observed for 24 hours. The rates of disintegration and the morphology and size of the residual sand particles are then compared. The comparison provides information that allows identification of individual construction and renovation phases. The method was developed to assist in the interpretation of historic buildings prior to conservation or demolition. The case study used for this paper is the farmhouse at Hillside, later named Perry Barr, south of Adelaide, South Australia. When the data for this house were integrated with the documented history of the house and with dateable fabrics used in each construction and renovation phase (e.g., bricks, linoleum, and decorative treatments), it was also possible to estimate a date for each individual phase."
2009,"Alcohol, Tobacco, and Excessive Animal Protein: The Question of an Adequate Diet in the Seventeenth-Century Chesapeake","Historical documents and faunal assemblages have indicated that the 17th-century Chesapeake English diet was, for the most part, nutritionally adequate and perhaps more so than the contemporary English diet. Pathological conditions observed on a number of 17th-century era human skeletons, however, including 19 individuals recovered from a single plantation cemetery in Maryland, suggest nutritional deficiencies in the colonists. The excessive but culturally acceptable consumption of meat, alcohol, and tobacco by the Chesapeake colonists appears to have affected nutrient absorption by at least some 17th-century colonists. Despite a potentially nutritious diet, the Chesapeake colonists suffered nutritional deficiencies that negatively impacted individual health."
2009,Farm and Factory: Agricultural Production Strategies and the Cheese and Butter Industry,"Published archaeological data from the Columbus Center Cheese Factory, combined with newly analyzed federal agricultural census data for the Town of Columbus, Chenango County, New York, illuminate changing agricultural production strategies. During the second half of the 19th century, farmers in central New York State shifted from sheep raising, grain agriculture, and household production of cheese and butter to the raising of forage crops and production of fluid milk for local cheese and butter factories. The analysis reveals a close, but not perfect, relationship between farm and factory—a relationship with implications for archaeological variability among late-19th-century farmsteads."
2009,Making the Most of Uncertainties at the Sanderson Farm,"This article advocates mining uncertainties for interpretive possibilities in a manner that fosters critical analysis, discovery, and reflexivity. An unexpected assemblage from a farm near Sutter Creek, California, is used to illustrate that approach. Several plausible scenarios are explored with a collaborative process that exposes the entire deliberative process and leaves conclusions in suspense. The stacked contingencies present throughout the interpretative process are first explored before constructing stories that help reveal underlying assumptions. That approach highlights the complexity and multivocality of the past while offering grounds for theoretical convergence."
2009,Upon This Rock: Salvage Archaeology at the Early-Eighteenth-Century Holmdel Baptist Church,"Religion has played an integral role in the settlement and growth of the United states since the earliest days of colonization. Aside from economic opportunity, freedom of religion and the desire to worship unmolested were the primary factors behind emigration to the U.S. during the 17th and 18th centuries. Church structures, or “meetinghouses,” were often the center for both secular and sacred activities. Town meetings to discuss civil affairs were held on weekdays under the same roofs as religious services conducted on Sundays. Recent repairs in the basement crawlspace of the Holmdel Baptist Church of Holmdel, New Jersey, built ca. 1705, necessitated an emergency salvage effort prior to the removal of nearly two feet of soil from under the church. This endeavor uncovered a wealth of artifacts and features that provides valuable insight into the design and dimension of the earliest section of the structure as well as the activities, beliefs, and social standing of the Baptist congregation."
2009,"Tea in God’s Light: An Analysis of Artifacts from the Friends Meetinghouse Site, Burlington, New Jersey","Proposed construction of a regional conference center at the Religious society of Friends Meetinghouse in Burlington, New Jersey, threatened the reported site of the original 17th-century meetinghouse. Excavations at the site (28BU432), which confirmed that the building was hexagonal in plan with a rectangular addition, resulted in the recovery of an artifact assemblage associated with site use of approximately 100 years. This paper presents a description of the artifact assemblage and an analysis of the behaviors and values reflected therein. The artifact assemblage recovered from excavations at the Burlington Friends Meetinghouse suggests that many meals were consumed on the premises, that few meals were prepared there, and that the choice of ceramics mirrored the Quaker value of simplicity."
2009,The John Street Methodist Church: An Archaeological Excavation with Native American Cooperation,"During construction work at the historic John Street Methodist Church in Lower Manhattan in New York city, workers found human bones near the foundation wall of the church. The minister and church leaders voluntarily halted the project so that archaeological work could be undertaken. Since the property had the potential to contain Native American or European American burials, the City Archaeology Program and the American Indian Community House undertook a joint excavation of the site. This was the first time in New York City that Native Americans worked on an archaeological excavation. No other human remains were found, but many artifacts from the mid-19th century were uncovered. The artifacts provide glimpses into the social behavior of the congregation."
2009,"Archaeology and Ethnohistory on the Spanish Colonial Periphery: Excavations at the Templo Colonial in Nicoya, Guanacaste, Costa Rica","Archaeological and historical investigations were carried out in the town of Nicoya, Costa Rica, between 1989 and 1991. The town is of historical interest as having been reported as the largest indigenous chiefdom along the northwest coast when the Spanish first reconnoitered the region in 1519. The settlement quickly become incorporated into the spanish colonial empire and persisted as a pueblo de Indios for close to 300 years. Excavations within and outside the purported colonial-age church in Nicoya failed to produce any evidence for a nucleated indigenous community, but they did uncover a colonial-age cemetery outside the church as well as several inhumations within the church presbytery. Archaeological and historical evidence also suggests that the church was rebuilt at least once in the past and that the current structure probably dates to the mid-19th century. This research indicates that indigenous Nicoya was not a single nucleated settlement, as has been generally held by archaeologists and historians. The Spanish more likely encountered a number of dispersed villages under the political leadership of a chief named Nicoya, and the current town of Nicoya is the result of a 16th-century reducción (forced resettlement) of these villages. Finally, the interpretation of the church’s history based on historical documents and archaeological investigations is contrasted to contemporary understanding of Nicoya’s history. The divergent histories provide additional insight into the important role the church structure plays in the lives and identities of the townspeople."
2009,"“Carry Me to Yon Kirk Yard”: An Investigation of Changing Burial Practices in the Seventeenth-Century Cemetery at St. Mary’s City, Maryland","Fifty-seven burials were excavated in the 17th-century cemetery at st. Mary’s city, Maryland. Through a unique combination of the structural history of the site and a detailed recording process, the burials are assigned to three 30-year periods, spanning ca. 1638–1730. This data is used to investigate changes in the use and construction of coffins, the function of copper pins, and the evolution of hand placement in the burials. These trends are related to larger changes in English burial practices."
2009,"“They Even Threaten the Sick That They Will Not Be Buried in the Churchyard”: Salvage Archaeology of the Raritan-in-the-Hills Cemetery, Somerset County, New Jersey","This article discusses the chance discovery and subsequent salvage archaeology of an early-18th-century German Lutheran burying ground in the mountains north of Pluckemin, somerset county, New Jersey. The project began purely as a salvage operation wrought by residential development; excavation techniques employed under less-than-ideal conditions and a description of the cemetery are presented. Documentary research revealed that the congregation had only lasted from ca. 1714 to 1756, during which time it endured a great deal of internal conflict. Osteological analysis permitted age/sex identification of most of the individuals interred in the cemetery, and the artifactual record provided an opportunity to explore some aspects of the burial practices employed. These data, together with observed variation in the location of individual graves within the cemetery, are used to formulate a possible interpretation that links the variations observed in the physical remnants of the cemetery with the historical record that speaks in detail about the social breakdown of the community during its brief 50-year existence. In brief, the interpretation offered here argues that the principal of social organization within Raritan-in-the-Hills shifted from one of corporate unity (Gemeinschaft) to individual survival (Geschellschaft) prior to its final dissolution."
2009,"“Resolved to Strike Out a New Path”: Consumerism and Iconographic Change in New Jersey Gravestones, 1680–1820","Late 18th- and early-19th-century gravestones from central New Jersey fail to show the urns and willows that one would expect in an area settled by expatriate New Englanders. The gravestones are ornamented instead with elaborate monograms and other neoclassical designs. This paper argues that the popularity of certain decorative motifs, particularly monograms, sometimes associated with signed and priced markers, highlights the growing importance of consumerism and an increasingly competitive market for memorials at the end of the 18th century. The monogram design, which cuts across religious and ethnic boundaries, was extremely popular for a short period. Undecorated Philadelphia-style markers soon supplanted these memorials, as New Jersey’s brownstone carving tradition faded, and national and indeed international trends supplanted local traditions."
2009,"Sacred Landscapes: Material Evidence of Ideological and Ethnic Choice in Long Island, New York, Gravestones, 1680–1800","Long Island grave markers from the 17th and 18th centuries are examined and analyzed. Due to its strategic location, between the English culture sphere of New England and the “Dutch” culture sphere of New Amsterdam/New York, Long Island is an excellent laboratory for studying cultural recombination in various forms of material culture. Long Island has no quarryable stone, so all colonial gravestones, except fieldstone markers, were imported from New England, New Jersey, or New York City. This study found a different pattern of motifs for Long Island compared to New England, but memorialization by status was more like that of New England than Virginia. Ideological, social, and ethnic boundaries are demonstrated. Location or proximity to a culture sphere also played a role in choice of grave marker, as did customary trade networks. More than 4,300 stones were photographed and statistically analyzed; the data are of use to scholars in many fields."
2009,Mortality Symbols in Action: Protestant and Catholic Memorials in Early-Eighteenth-Century West Ulster,"Material culture can carry many complementary and even conflicting messages simultaneously, to be read in varied ways by those observing it. Graveyard memorials link the living and the dead within a communal setting and are active in reinforcing conscious and unconscious values or in challenging them. The graveyard monuments of West Ulster offer an unusually rich sample of monuments with mortality symbols (skull, crossed bones, coffin, bell, and hourglass) as well as texts. Graveyards were the scenes of religious and social tension in 18th-century Ireland, and the memorials with their symbols and texts can be used to investigate the dynamics of identity played out in this arena. Although memorials were important in the dynamics of class and ethnic identities, emphasis is placed on religious identity here, an aspect of great importance in the past but one that has received less attention in historical archaeology than it deserves. Protestants and Catholics chose to use some of the same symbols on their memorials but assigned them meanings and associations appropriate to their theologies. Although they normally were buried in the same Anglican-controlled graveyard, symbol and text reflected and reinforced separate religious identities."
2008,"To Project an Order: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Spatial Construction in the Spanish Colony of Floridablanca (Patagonia, Eighteenth Century)","The interpretation of the meanings of constructed space plays an important role in understanding how a certain society might have been structured in the past. this paper presents the colony of Floridablanca (Patagonia, 18th century) and examines how the different discourse levels are articulated in the construction of the colony’s spaces according to the ideal model of a social order based on the principles of the Spanish Enlightenment. The focus is on the convergence and divergence between the material world and the narratives referring to such spaces created during the existence of the colony. This approach, developed by an interdisciplinary team, involved the inclusion and interpretation of historical, archaeological, and geophysical data. Studied along three lines of evidence, the narrative analyses and material construction show how the discourse on the social organization of Floridablanca articulates convergence and divergence from these planes in different ways for different sectors of the colony."
2008,The Market for Meat in Colonial Cuenca: A Seventeenth-Century Urban Faunal Assemblage from the Southern Highlands of Ecuador,"Excavation of a midden in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador, revealed faunal remains from a 17th-century elite urban family residence. this faunal data, combined with archival research on the Peñas/Ruiz family, demonstrates that the family raised sheep, cattle, and pigs for sale to the urban market in Cuenca. The absence of camelid and guinea pig remains in this faunal assemblage demonstrates that Eurasian ungulates were favored meat animals at this urban, Andean colonial-elite site."
2008,“Looking South”: Historical Archaeology in South America,"An overview of the history and development of historical archaeology in South America from its beginnings to the present is presented here, covering the origins, theoretical frameworks, and subjects of investigation. Historical archaeology in South America has experienced an accelerated growth since the mid-1980s. Taking these circumstances into account, some of the most outstanding projects headed by South American archaeologists during the last decades are analyzed."
2008,The Presentation of Self in Rural Life: The Use of Space at a Connected Farmstead,"Archaeological investigation at the Pettengill farmstead site, a mid-19th-century connected farmstead in southern New Hampshire, prompted questions regarding the use of divided spaces, along with associated economic and social implications. During the 19th century, nearly 60% of the farmsteads constructed in northern New England were built with the principal farm structures connected into a single sprawling block. this shift away from a disconnected arrangement was an attempt at increasing efficiency while maintaining a traditional way of life in the face of increased competition from western farms. By connecting the farmstead, farmers visually and functionally divided spaces, both utilitarian and symbolic. When combined with documentary evidence, this site illustrates how the arrangement of the farmstead space affected the Pettengills’ presentation of themselves to their community."
2008,Dietary Variability among a Sample of United States Soldiers during the War of 1812,"The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of human bone collagen have been used to determine the diet of a sample of United States soldiers who died during the siege of Fort Erie in the War of 1812. controls were enacted during the analysis to discriminate between well-preserved and contaminated bone. results from a sample of 15 individuals, recruited from diverse regions of the northeastern United States, indicate that the diet of this population was quite varied. Statistical analysis was used to explore the relationship between diet and skeletal pathologies. There were no significant differences in means between the individuals exhibiting skeletal pathologies and those not exhibiting skeletal pathologies, suggesting the pathologies are more likely tied to the physical hardships endured in these men’s civilian or military lives as opposed to their civilian or military diets."
2008,"Foodways, Economic Status, and the Antebellum Upland South in Central Kentucky","Regional cuisines or foodways have been a topic of interest to both historians and archaeologists for at least the past 30 years. scholars recognize a regional foodway in the antebellum Upland South that is part of the larger “Upland South” cultural tradition. The agricultural and archaeological data on subsistence in the antebellum Upland South have been woven into an idealized set of subsistence practices that revolved around agricultural practices. The examination of four contemporaneous faunal assemblages representative of different societal classes living in 19th-century Kentucky shows that this generalized version of Upland South food-ways does not hold true across economic classes. Instead, a closer look reveals that many people living on Kentucky’s antebellum farmsteads struggled regularly for food security and that the idealized version of a shared “Upland South foodway” was restricted to the wealthy planter class that had ready access to the market economy."
2008,"Seventeenth-Century Metal Production at San Marcos Pueblo, North-Central New Mexico","Histories of the early colonial period of the remote New Mexican colony (A.D. 1540–1680) are framed in terms of pueblo conversion, conflicts between church and state, and accommodation-resistance between the pueblos and the colonizers. Missing from these histories are detailed discussions of mining and metal production, even though it is widely recognized that spaniards came north looking for metal beginning with Coronado’s entrada in A.D. 1540. Accumulating archaeological evidence is beginning to change historical understanding of this neglected part of colonization history. In north-central New Mexico, San Marcos Pueblo is a microcosm of early colonial mining activity in the colony. To elucidate the San Marcos story, relevant histories, geology, archaeology, and materials are used. This broad methodological approach helps reveal the pattern of 17th-century metal production in the colony. The results are important for building knowledge about metal production in the New Mexico colony and for expanding scholarly understanding about this significant part of Spanish colonization on the far northern frontier."
2008,"Degrees of Alienation: The Material Evidence of the Irish and Irish American Experience, 1850–1910","Irish immigrants to the United States formed a large part of America’s poor from the mid-19th to the first decades of the 20th century. Considered the devious “foreign other,” they were exploited both in the workplace and in the landscape of U.S. cities. Irish immigrants formed communities in the relegated and marginalized spaces they were given and lived in cramped tenements that were fraught with unsanitary conditions. As a consequence of such environmental conditions, several epidemics occurred throughout the 19th century. Outbreaks emanating from these communities and spreading to other city neighborhoods caused panic amongst the U.S.-born citizens and in turn provided the fodder for stereotypes and moral judgments about the character of the Irish. Medicinal bottles recovered archaeologically from Irish and Irish-American deposits are physical manifestations of that social history of exploitation. It is argued here that there is a correlation between the shift from commercially prepared medicines to doctor-prescribed medicines and degrees of alienation of the Irish and Irish Americans in relation to mainstream society. the medicinal bottle data used in this research were recovered from two privies in the rear courtyards of two tenements at the Five Points, Manhattan (ca. 1850–1870) and from two single-family houses from the Dublin section, Paterson, New Jersey (ca. 1880–1910)."
2008,A Pledge of Peace: Evidence of the Cochise-Howard Treaty Campsite,"Historical maps, documents, and photographs have been combined with archaeological data to confirm the location of the cochise-Howard treaty camp. Brigadier General Oliver Otis Howard, his escorts Lieutenant Joseph Alton sladen and Thomas Jonathan Jeffords, and the chiricahua Apache chief cochise met in the foothills of the Dragoon Mountains of southern Arizona in October 1872 to negotiate the surrender and relocation of this “most troublesome Apache group” (Bailey 1999:17). Warfare between the Apache and the Americans had been ongoing for more than a decade. This meeting culminated in a peace treaty between Cochise’s Chokonen band and the United States government. Photographs of unique boulder formations confirm the treaty-negotiation location, and written landscape descriptions provide further verification. Wickiup rings, other feature types, and artifacts provide archaeological confirmation regarding the nature and spatial layout of the camp and clarify the vagaries of the historical record."
2008,"Overseas Chinese Archaeology: Historical Foundations, Current Reflections, and New Directions","As historical archaeologists increase their involvement in studies of Overseas Chinese communities, it is especially important that this research be grounded in a solid understanding of the history of the Chinese diaspora. A transnational framework is instrumental in facilitating an understanding of the ways in which Overseas Chinese communities and identities formed through global economic, political, and cultural networks. The archaeology of Overseas Chinese communities currently faces many challenges, including underpublication, a tendency towards descriptive rather than research-oriented studies, and orientalism. These difficulties are being surmounted through collaborative research programs that foster dialogue between archaeologists and Chinese heritage organizations, as well as through interdisciplinary exchanges that are forging new connections among historical archaeology and Asian American studies and Asian studies."
2008,The Response of California’s Chinese Populations to the Anti-Chinese Movement,"In the latter half of the 19th century, a strong anti-Chinese sentiment influenced U.S politics and newspapers. Driven by a number of factors, the anti-Chinese movement expressed itself against Chinese immigrants through legislation, organized boycotts, hostile news stories, violence, and general harassment. In many modern accounts, these Chinese immigrants are portrayed as passive victims who did not respond to the actions carried out against them. Contrary to this view, archaeological data has prompted a reassessment of contemporary historical accounts. Together, these sources indicate an aggressive campaign by Chinese immigrants to counter these activities. Through organized and individual efforts, Chinese immigrants fought back in the legislature, the courts, their homes, places of business, and on the streets."
2008,Between the Household and the World System: Social Collectivity and Community Agency in Overseas Chinese Archaeology,"At the Market Street Chinatown in San Jose, California, residential arrangements were profoundly shaped by institutionalized racism, anti-Chinese violence, labor practices, and immigration policies. These, in turn, shaped the form and content of the archaeological record. As is typical of many Overseas Chinese sites, archaeological features cannot be associated with specific households—in fact, the “household” concept is not always pertinent. A contextual, multiscalar approach to research on this residential community highlights other forms of social collectivity, such as district associations and business consortiums, that were able to act meaningfully to promote community survival and well-being. The archaeology of Overseas Chinese communities has a significant contribution to make to archaeological method and theory by opening new pathways of inquiry into the “middle scale” between the individual or household and the world system."
2008,Chinese Masculinities and Material Culture,"Most Overseas Chinese living in the United States during the 19th century were men. Correspondingly, the archaeology of Overseas Chinese communities in the United States is primarily the archaeology of Chinese men: their behaviors, dispositions, activities, and identities. Despite this acknowledged focus, masculinity is rarely an explicit object of study in Overseas Chinese archaeology. Drawing from methods and theories in archaeology, cultural anthropology, history, and Asian American studies, a framework for the archaeological investigation of masculinities at Overseas Chinese communities is developed. This framework is used to describe how material culture from the Market Street Chinatown in San Jose, California, was interpolated in multiple hegemonic discourses of masculinity."
2008,Gathering Insights on Isolation,"For about a century, very small groups of Chinese or solitary individuals exploited maritime resources on the central California coast. The locations were isolated, depending on the preferred habitat of the particular natural resource being sought and the optimum economic distance from the nearest competitor. The seaweed-gathering enterprise of Wong How persisted virtually unchanged until 1975, and his dwelling still stands. Architectural analysis reveals vernacular construction based on salvaged materials, innovation in response to problem solving, traditional custom, and expansion by accretion. Archival data flesh out the portrait of an individual and his family on both sides of the Pacific. The small, uncontrolled collection recovered by others could be misleading if the high proportion of Chinese items is interpreted to imply less accommodation to the Western world than really occurred. Wong How lived in isolation; pursued a traditional industry; read, ate, and drank within Chinese traditions; and yet participated in broad mercantile, financial, and legal networks to the extent that served his needs."
2008,Late-Nineteenth-Century Chinese Farm Workers in the California Mother Lode,"Most archaeological studies of Chinese immigrants have focused on enclaves in cities, towns, villages, and work camps where insular tendencies are expected. This article focuses instead on the adaptations of Chinese immigrants employed at a small farm in the California Mother Lode region where they lived and worked in more ethnically mixed settings. Investigations at CA-AMA-364/H provide insights into adjustments made by the Chinese immigrants between 1851 and the turn of the century. Examination of a ledger left at the site in 1857 by a Chinese cook enhances those interpretations."
2008,"The Chinese Experience in Deadwood, South Dakota","Four years of excavations and research on the Chinatown Project has begun to chronicle the Chinese experience in Deadwood, South Dakota. Major features encountered include burned structural remnants, architectural remains, privies, refuse pits, and dumping episodes. A unique pit feature suggests evidence of a possible ceremonial disposal of personal possessions. Archaeological evidence collected from buried remains of a ceremonial burner built by the Chinese in 1908 suggests Deadwood’s Chinese community used this structure for mortuary rituals until some time in the 1920s. Asian ceramic vessels are similar in shapes and designs to those found at other Overseas Chinese sites, as are glass bottle assemblages, opium smoking paraphernalia, coins, gaming items, and clothing. Through a combination of historical research and archaeological excavations, Deadwood’s Chinatown offers an understanding of a significant contribution to early life in a small western town, rich with a society comprising various ethnic populations."
2008,Roots Entwined: Archaeology of an Urban Chinese American Cemetery,"Archaeological excavations conducted in the Chinese section of Portland’s Lone Fir Cemetery provide a rare opportunity to study the materials associated with the late-19th- and early-20th-century funerary practices of an urban Chinese American community. In conjunction with documentary evidence, the materials show that Portland’s Chinese immigrants and their descendants preserved traditional Chinese customs and selectively incorporated European and American elements into funeral rituals as they actively forged transnational identities as Chinese Americans."
2008,"Transnational Identity and Mortuary Material Culture: The Chinese Plantation Cemetery in Pāhala, Hawai’i","From the late-19th to the early-20th centuries, immigrant laborers from a wide range of countries were brought to Hawai’i by white plantation owners who were in need of a large and inexpensive labor force. Initially hired as indentured servants and segregated by ethnic group in plantation contexts, these workers continued to maintain strong ethnic/national identities, even after settling in Hawai’i. In contemporary Hawai’i, identities that developed in the plantation context have combined with the Hawaiian culture of aloha and diversity to form a distinctive “local” culture, in which ethnic identity and local birth are simultaneously prized. A survey of grave markers of the Chinese worker cemetery associated with Pāhala Plantation has revealed the ways in which these markers were used to negotiate the eventual formation of the “local” culture in present day Hawai’i."
2008,"The Luck of Third Street: Archaeology of Chinatown, San Bernardino, California","In 2001, field excavations were completed at the site of the San Bernardino, California, Chinatown, yielding about 10,000 items. Twenty-one discrete features were excavated, dating from about 1880 to the 1930s. Seventeen of these features reflected the history of Chinatown. Privy 1035, associated with a gambling hall at 19 Third Street, contained more than 6,800 individual items, representing diverse aspects of Chinatown life. Gambling activities in the early-20th century were represented by an abundance of artifacts, including a cache of more than 1,300 Asian coins, the largest ever found on an excavation in North America. Discussions of gambling artifacts and culture document the practice of this traditional, but often sensationalized, pastime of the Overseas Chinese."
2008,“The strange and unusual”: Material and Social Dimensions of Chinese Identity,"This volume examines the material dimensions of Chinese identity. This scholarship complicates the connection between commodities and identity, while it simultaneously destabilizes those very identities. The question of how material distinctions shape social experience is at the heart of contemporary identity archaeologies, and the Overseas Chinese archaeologies in this collection illuminate the challenge of how to position distinctive collectives in relation to a broader American “mainstream.” The most interesting Overseas Chinese archaeologies paint a picture that rejects easy divisions between assimilation and resistance and probe how Chinese material distinctions reflect complicated accommodations along class, gender, and color lines that structured life for the Overseas Chinese."
2008,The Asian American Comparative Collection: A Unique Resource for Archaeologists and Historians,"The Asian American Comparative Collection (AACC) is an exceptional repository containing artifacts, images, and documentary materials essential for understanding Asian American archaeological sites, economic contributions, and cultural history. It serves as an information clearinghouse for identifying artifacts made in China and Japan and for researching Asian American topics."
2008,"Personal Adornment and Interlaced Identities at the Sherburne Site, Portsmouth, New Hampshire","Items of personal adornment are an important class of material culture with great potential for understanding constructions of identity in the historical period. Archaeologically recoverable remains of dress—clothing and clothing fasteners, jewelry, hair accessories, and miscellaneous accessories—are included in this category of material culture. Performative aspects of identity construction, the presentation of a person as an individual and as a member of a socially defined group, and the centrality of the body in perception and self-perception are a means for examining the construction of identity along gender, class, age, and ethnicity lines. Personal adornment artifacts are the physical remains of the ways people inscribed the body as reflective of their alignment with individual and group identities and the performances of identity that were enacted through mundane daily acts and gestures in the past. Artifacts recovered at the Sherburne site in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, manifest these identities."
2008,Archaeology at the Parvin Homestead: Searching for the Material Legacy of the Underground Railroad,"Archaeological evidence of the Underground Railroad is difficult to identify and interpret, as the archaeological signature of sites relating to the Underground Railroad is defined by the clandestine and transient nature of the movement of fugitives. Archaeologists’ understanding of the material legacy of the Underground Railroad is further clouded by legends identifying houses of local luminaries as Underground Railroad sites, often with minimal corroborating evidence. In 2000 and again in 2005, archaeological investigations were conducted at the Parvin Homestead, in Berks County, Pennsylvania, reputed by local oral tradition to be an Underground Railroad safe house. The current owners contend that 19th-century occupants harbored African Americans escaping from slavery and that a network of tunnels used for this purpose crisscross the property. Historical research and archaeological excavations were conducted to determine whether tunnels existed on the property and whether any other material legacy of the Underground Railroad could be identified."
2008,In Search of Unique Iberian Ship Design Concepts,"Defining 15th- and 16th-century Iberian shipbuilding traditions related to European expansion overseas is a difficult task. Scarce documentary evidence and the systematic destruction of Spanish and Portuguese shipwrecks by those with a purely monetary agenda make the task even more complex. In spite of these obstacles, data suggests that a distinctive shipbuilding tradition existed on the Iberian Peninsula. Through careful mining of the documentary and archaeological evidence, the concepts behind Iberian ship design can be articulated as well as compared and contrasted to other European shipbuilding traditions."
2008,The Archaeology of Temporary Construction Devices on Historic Building Sites in the Southeast,"Distinctive archaeological features can be attributed to the life cycle of buildings from construction to destruction. One group of features that has not been closely examined on historic sites are those resulting from the erection of construction devices such as derricks and scaffolding. Descriptions of these devices in the literature are provided. Archaeological features of derricks and scaffolds on house sites in Tennessee and Virginia are compared to those in the literature. Attributes such as distance from the building, spacing, and feature fill that differentiates them from other earthfast features are discussed. The identification of such temporary construction features is important for understanding the level of technology employed in American construction, dating buildings under construction, origins, and possible ethnic affiliation of these devices."
2008,"Excavating America’s Metaphor: Race, Diaspora, and Vindicationist Archaeologies","Over more than a century, African diasporan scholars have defined identity in complex forms that aspire to resist racial essentialism yet stake consequential political claims to collective roots. Historical archaeology has painted a rich picture of the material details of African American life that also refutes black essentialism; however, archaeologists have crafted many utterly fluid African diasporan identities that sometimes fail to examine the global connections, antiracist citizen rights, and concrete cultural heritage long examined by diasporan scholars. An empirically and politically rigorous African diasporan archaeology would be significantly extended by diasporan scholarship’s vindicationist and reflective antiracist perspectives. such an archaeology could disrupt essentialist categories and outline concrete foundations for diasporan identity without lapsing into either particularism or hyperconstructivism."
2008,Living in Cities Today,"Urban archaeology is a challenging endeavor. Defining urban archaeology is not straightforward. Doing urban archaeology is difficult for various intellectual and practical reasons. Theories employed by urban archaeologists are multifarious and must be as sophisticated and complex as the urban entities in which investigation proceeds. Despite these challenges (or perhaps because of them), urban archaeology is unquestionably a very rewarding and necessary undertaking. Contributions made by urban archaeologists over the past 15 years demonstrate this fact. A recent archaeological survey within the urban corridor between Las Cruces, New Mexico, and El Paso, Texas, is a particular illustration of both the challenges and rewards of urban archaeology."
2008,"“Cats Here, Cats There, Cats and Kittens Everywhere”: An Urban Extermination of Cats in Nineteenth-Century Cincinnati","In 1981 and 1982, Miami Purchase Association for Historic Preservation conducted a salvage excavation in Cincinnati’s Betts-Longworth neighborhood, a multiethnic community with both working class and upper-middle class residents. Excavations of a privy resulted in the recovery of an exceptionally large number of cat remains in a single depositional sequence dating to the late-19th century. A minimum of 57 cats and kittens were identified in the assemblage, with 47 of those individuals being kittens. While it is quite common to identify small numbers of animals such as cats, dogs, and rats in privy contexts, such a great number of individuals is largely unheard of. To explain why such large numbers of cats were exterminated, researchers explored several theories, including deviance, carcass disposal, population control, and urban sanitation concerns."
2008,Plats and Place: The Transformation of 19th Century Speculation Townsites on the Sacramento River,"Speculation townsites were integral to 19th-century California settlement and economic expansion and were often planned, formal landscapes based on explicitly urban templates. Inherently profit driven but frequently unsuccessful, many sites survived only as highly fragmentary or dependent rural entrepôts. The juxtaposition of a formal “plan” with the evolving vernacular reality of such places makes them highly significant for an understanding of 19th-century western American landscapes, both as a discrete settlement type and as a broader form of spatial organization. This speculation process defined much of the cultural landscape of the lower Sacramento River between the 1840s and World War I. Early townsite development linked settlement communities, evolving waterway infrastructure, and general land use patterns in systems that were, if not conventionally urban, emphatically cosmopolitan in nature. Two such townsites along the Sacramento illustrate very different strategies in this evolving landscape of capital manipulation, land speculation, and community formation."
2008,"Urban Archaeology at the Site of the Argosy Casino: The Materiality of Social Change in the Canal Town of Lawrenceburg, Southern Indiana","Lawrenceburg was a dynamic community in southern Indiana during the 19th century. Via the Ohio River and Whitewater Canal, this planned urban center was poised to take advantage of emerging financial opportunities related to commercial activities. As the canal failed, Lawrenceburg was unable to compete with larger metropolitan centers like nearby Cincinnati. This paper examines the material record of three home lots in one of this community’s neighborhoods as changes in transportation infrastructure altered the physical and cultural landscape over time. This once-vibrant urban neighborhood evolved into a marginal residential enclave, altering social relations of class and ethnicity."
2008,Economic Stability and Social Identity: Historic Preservation in Old North St. Louis,"Since the 1950s, the Old North St. Louis neighborhood in St. Louis, Missouri, has suffered population loss and disinvestment due to failed urban renewal initiatives, the construction of a new interstate highway that bisected the community, and suburbanization. Under the auspices of a U.S. Housing and Urban Development Community Outreach Partnership Center grant, the Public Policy Research Center at the University of Missouri-St. Louis partnered with the Old North St. Louis community to assist it in attaining economic growth, social stability, and a cultural identity through archaeological research and interpretation. Building off existing historic preservation initiatives, this partnership employed “true acts of inclusion” in developing with the community the major goals and the “questions that count.” Archaeological work in conjunction with oral histories and archival research was used to strengthen the sense of community through development of K-12 educational programming, a local neighborhood museum, a video documentary, a published history, a website, and an historic bike trail. These products provided the tools to attract new residents, investors, and visitors to the neighborhood and served as cultural glue, connecting people to place. The project advances the concept of public archaeology by demonstrating how research and interpretation can be aligned with specific urban revitalization goals."
2008,Marketing in a Multicultural Neighborhood: An Archaeology of Corner Stores in the Urban Midwest,"Corner stores were the most common consumer outlet in the urban Midwest from the mid-19th century until World War II. In the early-20th century in Indianapolis, Indiana, the near westside was dotted with more than 100 modest stores managed by African Americans, European immigrants, and white Hoosiers. Archaeological excavation of a ca. 1889–1969 store illuminates the widespread entrepreneurial ambition of urban newcomers, the increasing ethnic insularity of corner stores between 1900 and 1920, and the eventual decline of corner stores in the face of urban renewal and the arrival of chain stores in the 1930s."
2008,Seneca Village and Little Africa: Two African American Communities in Antebellum New York City,"African Americans in antebellum New York City followed several different residence strategies in the face of ongoing discrimination. Most lived in enclaves, dispersed throughout poorer neighborhoods that were by no means primarily black. One such enclave was Little Africa. Some lived separately in places like Seneca Village, an African American community just outside of town. This study compares the residents of these two neighborhoods and suggests that the members of these groups were quite different from each other in a number of ways. Aggregation of these differences suggests that the groups represent different socioeconomic classes. This finding runs counter to the views of many commentators and scholars (including archaeologists) who talk about the “African American community,” implying that the African American population formed (and forms) a homogeneous whole."
2008,"Aristocracies of Labor: Craft Unionism, Immigration, and Working-Class Households in West Oakland, California","Within the railroad industry, the most powerful labor unions were exclusive craft organizations that concentrated on defending the privileges of a few skilled workers. Data from archaeological work conducted by Sonoma State University during the Cypress Freeway Replacement Project is used in an historical materialist exploration of class-consciousness among railroad workers in a late-19th-century working-class neighborhood in West Oakland, California. Comparing aspects of diet and dining, this study focuses on divisions among the railroad workers along the lines of craft-skill and nativity, examining the ways skilled craft unionists used the assumptions of Victorian ideology to organize against both their employers and other groups of workers, especially immigrants."
2007,Archaeological Evidence of Economic Activities at an Eighteenth-Century Frontier Outpost in the Western Great Lakes,"During the late-19th and early-20th centuries, antiquarian collectors amassed hundreds of artifacts from the vicinity of Fort St. Joseph (20BE23), a mission-garrison-trading post complex established by the French in the late-17th century along the St. Joseph River in southwest Michigan. George Quimby (1939, 1966) later used these materials to establish a chronology for post-contact Native American sites in the western Great Lakes region, although the research potential of the collections was limited by their lack of provenience. Subsequent fieldwork conducted in 2002 and 2004 by Western Michigan University located intact deposits from this site. Excavations have identified a number of cultural features and associated archaeological materials that suggest the locations of buildings and discrete activity areas. The undisturbed deposits encountered at the site of Fort St. Joseph can inform researchers about everyday economic activities at an important trading post in the North American interior."
2007,Keeping Edison’s Secrets: Archaeological Documentation of Thomas A. Edison’s Menlo Park Patent Vault,"Archaeologists recently conducted fieldwork at the site of Thomas A. Edison’s Menlo Park Laboratory. Excavations revealed and documented a long-forgotten subterranean vault used by Edison to store patent drawings, scientific laboratory notebooks, office records, and other valuable documents associated with the operation of his pioneering industrial research and development facility. The vault highlights Edison’s concern with the collection and protection of company documents and his intellectual property, as well as his ongoing attempts to control the dissemination of information regarding his inventions."
2007,"Tell-Tale Trees: Historical Dendroarchaeology of Log Structures at Rocky Mount, Piney Flats, Tennessee","The Rocky Mount site has important historical and cultural significance for the State of Tennessee because it was built by one of its earliest settlers and served as the capital of the territory from 1790 to 1792. Questions arose concerning whether the two main log structures—known as the Cobb House with adjoining dining room—were built by William Cobb between 1770 and 1772. The authors used tree-ring dating to determine the year(s) of construction of these two log structures. Three nearby reference tree-ring chronologies anchored the Rocky Mount tree-ring chronology from 1667 to 1829. Cutting dates obtained from 19 logs revealed that the Cobb House was built beginning in 1827 and finished by 1828, while the dining room was begun in 1829 and finished by 1830. An additional six logs had outermost dates between 1820 and 1825. These 25 logs demonstrate, instead, that Michael Massengill constructed the house and dining room between 1827 and 1830."
2007,Transformations in San Diego County Gravestones and Cemeteries,"San Diego County, California, USA, is home to more than 100 cemeteries and nearly 300,000 individually marked graves. Analysis of the region’s cemeteries and grave markers by members of the San Diego County Gravestone Project has pinpointed significant patterns in commemoration strategies, evident through temporal, spatial, and formal trends. The material expressions of death seen in southern California graveyards reflect changing mortuary attitudes and parallel other diachronic cultural phenomena of modern American society during the 19th and 20th centuries. In offering an overview of every San Diego County cemetery, this work develops a classification for the region’s graveyards. It also uses spatially controlled stylistic evolutions to pinpoint different degrees of regularity in gravestone change. These trends reveal attenuation in the communication and spread of ideas regarding mortality from urban areas to more rural settings in San Diego County."
2007,"Pottery in the Mormon Economy: An Historical, Archaeological, and Archaeometric Study","Pottery production was important to Latter-day Saint communities and distinguished these towns from their non-Mormon neighbors. The potters and workers left scant records that reveal how their wares fit into Utah’s theocratically organized economy. Potters and potteries of 19th-century Utah and the Mormon Domain were part of an archaeological survey conducted between 1999 and 2000. The research project yielded examples of kiln wasters that could be subjected to instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The results demonstrate the utility of integrating primary records and archaeometric tools in the study of historical era economic processes. Data also indicate the applicability of the approach for potteries in close geographic proximity and to determine patterns of variation within site assemblages. The authors propose an anthropological research program to explore the economics of religion in Mormon Utah, combining the analytical power of archaeometry with the contextualized questioning possible in historical archaeology."
2007,Eliciting Contraband through Archaeology: Illicit Trade in Eighteenth-Century St. Augustine,"The study of contraband (illicit trade) should offer a uniquely appropriate focus for the multi-evidentiary strengths of historical archaeology, in that it demands the articulation of largely undocumented economic activity (reflected materially in archaeological remains) with legal mandates and formal regulations about commerce. Problematic issues in realizing this are presented by the recognition of contraband goods and activities in the archaeological record and by the difficulties in articulating archaeologically derived periodicity with text-based periodicity of contraband in a given community. With those concerns in mind, the analysis of excavated data from six 18th-century households of St. Augustine is described here with extensive historical documentation of contraband activity in Spanish Florida and the Spanish Americas in general to explore the notion that historical archaeological integration of data about contraband can reveal useful information not knowable from either source alone. Results suggest that at a community-wide scale of analysis, the archaeological data essentially reify and add detail to the already existing documentary accounts of contraband trade. A household scale of analysis and comparison reveals how people with specific economic, occupational, religious, ethnic, and social identities engaged in contraband as a strategy in ways that were not previously known. This helps define the contours of economic possibility and creates a more nuanced understanding of the structure, opportunity, and dynamics of economic choice and agency within a community."
2007,An Historic Chinese Abalone Fishery on California’s Northern Channel Islands,"Beginning in the 1850s, Chinese abalone fishermen developed an intensive commercial fishery focused on the abundant black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) stocks of Alta and Baja California. They systematically harvested and dried tons of abalone meat and shells from intertidal waters and shipped them to markets in mainland China and America. Several legislative attempts were made to curtail Chinese involvement in the fishing industry, claiming they were harvesting abalone without regard to size. Recent research documents the abundance, distribution, and constituents of historic abalone sites and discusses the impact of “Chinese” abalone fishermen on San Miguel Island, California. Thousands of shell measurements show that the Chinese harvested larger abalones than those collected by Native American foragers for 10,000 years prior to European contact, providing important data on local ecology during the early historic period."
2007,Silences and Mentions in History Making,"Until historical archaeologists accept the historicities of societies lying partially or wholly outside the orbit of Western influences, they will not confront the anthropological conundrum of silencing others’ pasts. History making—framing archaeological practice with questions that count and critically analyzing the conflicts and congruencies among sources—transcends disciplinary boundaries and accounts for any moment in which historical representation unfolds. Several scholars have recently suggested different perspectives on archaeology applied to historical questions in Africa, including representations about the methods and theoretical views of historical practice in Africa. Given the more than a century of historical archaeology in Africa, it is compelling to evaluate key statements for both shortcomings as well as productive insights. Disjunctive and supplemental practice as well as critical interrogation of local historiographies and materialities have a long application in Africa and best realize the ultimate goal of history and anthropology, making new pasts and exposing the potentialities of a truly historical archaeology."
2007,"Image, Text, Object: Interpreting Documents and Artifacts as ‘Labors of Representation’","How can historical archaeologists best integrate documentary images and texts with archaeological evidence? The concept of “labor of representation” draws attention to the physical efforts, strategic decisions, and political projects inherent in representational practices, allowing archaeologists to rigorously account for the social production of historical documents without negating their evidentiary value. Contextual analysis of Joseph de Urrutia’s plan drawings of Spanish-colonial presidios demonstrates this approach, revealing systematic representational conventions. Overall, Urrutia depicted the settlements as more homogeneous and with more formal spatial order than was likely the case. The plan drawings are also shaped by an ideological boundary between military order and civilian disorder. Archaeological investigations that have taken the Urrutia drawings to be reliable “as-built” plans have tended to neglect or misinterpret those elements of the archaeological record that are most closely related to local, indigenous, and vernacular cultural practices."
2007,"Privies and Parasites: The Archaeology of Health Conditions in Albany, New York","Large numbers of parasites were identified in archaeological samples collected from privies and other features in excavations in Albany, New York. This information provides the largest database available for the study of parasite infections in historical period American cities. The greatest numbers of parasites were in contexts related to the expansion of the city in the late-18th century. Parasites remained, but their quantities decreased in the 19th century during another period of rapid population growth. The city was able to control parasite infection during this period through several means, including new techniques of privy construction, new water supply systems, and medical treatments. Use of medical treatments against parasites varied among residents of the city and was evident in the archaeological record."
2007,"Nativism, Resistance, and Ethnogenesis of the Florida Seminole Indian Identity","The Seminole Indians of Florida call themselves the “unconquered people,” referring to the years of the Second Seminole War (1835–1842) when the U.S. Army failed to remove them to Indian Territory. Although the Seminoles have diverse origins and a deep cultural foundation in the prehistoric Southeast, their modern identity can be traced to this era of military conflict. Nativistic resistance movements aided by a strengthening of clan ties formed an adaptive response to the threat of cultural extinction and fueled the process of Seminole ethnogenesis. Using the archaeological record in conjunction with historical and anthropological sources brings a new perspective to the study of ethnogenesis by identifying material dimensions of Seminole resistance and unity. Specifically, the presence and absence of aboriginal versus European American pottery, the presence of military buttons at Seminole sites, and evidence for the ceremonial exchange of wealth by clans are examined as material evidence for the process of identity formation."
2007,A Preliminary Analysis of Historic Shipwrecks in Northern Ireland,"Recent marine survey programs have generated a GIS (geographic information system) distribution of historic wreck sites around the coast of Northern Ireland. These data lead to an understanding of the nature and extent of submerged cultural resources and provide statistical information on the spatial and temporal distribution of historic wrecks, allowing for the reconstruction of past maritime activity. This is important baseline data used for the production of integrated research and management plans for the protection of the resources."
2007,"The Assimilation of Marine Geophysical Data into the Maritime Sites and Monuments Record, Northern Ireland","Northern Ireland has been subject to significant maritime influences throughout its known 9,000-year human history. In 1997, the University of Ulster, in partnership with the Environment and Heritage Service, embarked on a program of seabed mapping in an attempt to record the submerged and buried archaeological resources. To date, the geophysical research program has imaged about 80 19th- and 20th-century wrecks and about 100 targets of further “archaeological potential.” One method of integrating the results of geophysical surveys into the Maritime Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) is the use of the classification scheme CEBESSt, an alphanumeric wreck-site classification scheme based upon six site-specific variables: Composition of hull, Energy of wreck environment, Burial, Exposure, Structural integrity, and Substrate type, with t corresponding to time (the year of wrecking, if known). The classification is designed for use within a database scheme that allows for interrogation through character recognition and pattern matching."
2007,"Investigations of Taymouth Castle, a Nineteenth-Century Composite Ship Lost off the Coast of Northern Ireland","Taymouth Castle was a fully rigged ship, wrecked off the coast of Northern Ireland in January 1867. The importance of the wreck lies in the preservation of a quantity of its cargo, which provides a unique insight into the material culture of the trade of northwestern Europe with the Far East in the 19th century. It also demonstrates the enlightened approach that government in Northern Ireland has towards the documentation and management of the submerged shipwreck resource in its coastal waters."
2007,"The French Shipwreck La Surveillante, Lost in Bantry Bay, Ireland, in 1797","Survey work was undertaken on the wreck of the French frigate La Surveillante, part of a planned invasion force of Ireland in an attempt to overthrow English rule, which was lost in Bantry Bay off the southwestern coast of Ireland in January 1797. Some of the published background history of French frigates describes a similar type to La Surveillante. Archaeological investigations found that preservation on the wreck is exceptional for Irish waters and that its study offers a valuable insight into the structure, morphology, and role of the frigate in the later part of the 18th century."
2007,"Bantry Bay, County Cork, a Fortified Maritime Landscape","Coastal fortification is an important component of the maritime cultural landscape, charged with the protection of settlements and the repulsion of hostile parties. Bantry Bay in southwestern Ireland features a range of martial monuments, ranging from medieval castle sites to 19th-century gun emplacements, within an outstanding maritime landscape. The monuments display great continuity in siting, often at vantage points overlooking sheltered anchorages and bays, reflecting the importance of maritime communication in the region. Their evolution and proliferation show the contemporary military trends as well as the wider political and economic concerns of a society in conflict."
2007,The Sequence of Early Christian Period Horizontal Tide Mills at Nendrum Monastery: An Interim Statement,"A pioneering archaeological survey of the intertidal zone in Strangford Lough was undertaken between 1995–2000. In the course of the work, excavation was undertaken at a stone structure that produced evidence for three sea-powered horizontal mills. The mills are situated beside the famous early monastery of Nendrum. They formed an important part of the monastic complex from the early 7th through to the 8th centuries. The archaeological evidence demonstrates the high level of development in mill technology at that period."
2007,Archaeology of the Strangford Lough Kelp Industry in the Eighteenth- and Early-Nineteenth Centuries,An archaeological survey of the maritime cultural landscape of Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland found rich and varied remains of structures relating to the kelp industry. Adding this information to historical documentation provided great insight into the rapid rise of an economic asset in the 18th century and its equally rapid decline in the early-19th century. Kelp provided an essential material for major industries of the industrial revolution and was a major source of income in coastal Ireland. This paper traces the imprint left on the foreshore and coastal archaeology of an Irish Sea lough by the exploitation of seaweed for making kelp.
2007,On the Banks of the Bann: The Riverine Economy of an Ulster Plantation Village,"Research excavations at Movanagher, the chief Londonderry Plantation settlement of the Mercers’ Company of London, focused upon the role of the River Bann in the local and regional economy. Sited in 1611 near an ancient ford on the second longest river in Ireland and adjacent to established salmon fisheries, eel fisheries, extensive timber tracts and abundant clay resources, Movanagher was designed for profit, not defense, and ultimately succumbed to the Irish Rebellion of 1641. The archaeology of this green-field site with its mill, fisheries, brickworks, bawn, and scattered dwellings provides valuable insight into the central role of the river, both in daily life and in the process of the plantation itself. It highlights the mindset, motivations, and ultimate miscalculations of the English who planned the settlement, while underscoring the complexity of relations between natives and newcomers."
2007,"“Guns, Harpoons, Lances, Casks and every [necessary] article”: An account of the History and Archaeology of an Eighteenth-Century Shore-Based Whaling and Basking Shark Fishery in Donegal Bay","Landowners were probably the most important social, economic, and political force for change in 18th-century Ireland and were in the strongest position to shape the economy and environment of the island (Kelly 1985). In southwestern Donegal, a whaling company was founded by local landed entrepreneurs and merchants on the back of attempts to develop the fisheries of the northwest in general. Although this was not a longstanding venture, it pre-dates the later Norwegian-run whaling stations on the West Coast by some 130 years (Fairley 1981). Documentation consists of generalized accounts, including various petitions to the Irish Parliament for financial aid, as well as accounts in contemporary journals. Documentary data is not captured at the individual site level and, because of this, the location of the shore-based station is not definite. A site in the townland of Port, near Inver, is tentatively suggested as a possible location for a tryworks (the name given to the iron pots used for boiling the oil out of the blubber of whales), or at least a location where the activity of flensing or cutting-in (the process of removing blubber from the whale’s carcass) was carried out (Figure 1)."
2007,Topical Convergence: Historical Archaeologists and Historians on Common Ground,"Although historical archaeologists and historians seem to operate in different worlds, they often coexist in the same agencies and companies under the umbrella of cultural resource management (CRM) or, outside the United States, cultural heritage management. While the disciplines’ journals, coursework, and career paths are separate, historical archaeologists and historians may end up working on the same projects or within the same programs. Outside the academy, their disciplines have developed side by side. The professions have been connected through much of the 20th century, often in the context of public interpretation and policy. This common ground of public history and public archaeology can provide a firm foundation for interdisciplinary cooperation in serving public interest in the past. An interconnected development of the disciplines is presented before considering cross-disciplinary work and the importance of such work to the public."
2007,"A Test Case of Transdisciplinary Research Theory and Practice: Adena, the Home of Thomas Worthington","By the mid-1990s, the Ohio Historical Society had institutionalized a team approach to produce historical knowledge and interpretation at public sites. This approach follows a mode of research, referred to as transdisciplinary, by which many forms of new knowledge are being created in a postacademic setting. In this new setting, research is completed for the benefit of society and is produced through the cooperative efforts of several key specialists. Archaeological research at Adena, the plantation estate built by Thomas Worthington in 1807, just north of Chillicothe, Ohio, shows how transdisciplinary research has emerged as the dominant form of research at historic sites. Three distinct periods of research at the site are used to show how methodological approaches to research at public institutions have progressed over time to promote a theoretically based team approach to knowledge production."
2007,Historians and Archaeologists: An English Perspective,"Some historical differences between the intellectual roots of archaeology in Europe and the United States will be outlined in order to focus on the relationship between history and medieval/postmedieval archaeology, using England as a specific case study. In particular, the importance of English “landscape history” as an interdisciplinary project will be discussed. Some philosophical and theoretical aspects will be briefly reviewed, but here the primary focus is on the practical issues created by trying to apply interdisciplinary approaches within the context of commercial archaeology."
2007,Crossing the Great Divide,"This examination of how historical archaeology relates to other academic disciplines such as history and geography identifies some approaches to historians that act to create a disciplinary backwater or archaeological ghetto where life is untroubled, and mainstream research about the past flows past untouched by archaeological evidence. It argues that historical archaeologists need to pursue their own interests in the past in engagement with the documentary and the archaeological records. The key to successful interdisciplinary work is having a clear understanding of the other disciplines as well as having confidence in what historical archaeology can offer."
2007,What Are We Really Learning through Publicly Funded Historical Archaeology (and Is It Worth the Considerable Expense?),"Historical archaeology has become an established discipline within the last 30 years, yet to some its value is unrecognized or open to question. The reason for this can be found in several areas. As a discipline, historical archaeology has yet to develop a coherent approach to the study of the historic past or to the identification of sites that are truly worthy of preservation or study at public expense. Reports of excavations are cumbersome and difficult to use by other archaeologists, let alone by professionals in other disciplines or the interested public. We are probably spending considerable money on sites that really do not warrant the effort. As a whole, our literature does clearly illustrate the value of our accomplishments. To remedy what is in reality a decades-old problem requires leadership from the profession and from individual professionals. We need to redefine what we as a discipline are attempting to accomplish and how it is best accomplished, redefine priorities for publicly funded archaeology, establish a meaningful threshold of significance, reinvent our reports, challenge other scholars with our findings and interpretations, and insist that publicly funded projects result in publicly oriented products."
2007,A Dictionary of Blacksmithing Terms,"Blacksmithing remained an omnipresent and essential trade in the west only so long as wrought iron was the basic ferrous commodity of western society. The introduction of the Bessemer process, beginning in the late 1850s, heralded the age of mass-produced steel and modern industrial manufacturing technologies, and with it the irreversible decline and eventual demise of blacksmithing. Many of the skills and secrets of working wrought iron, once acquired and passed on through a long-standing oral tradition shared among blacksmiths has, like its practitioners, also disappeared. This dictionary attempts to provide many of the orally preserved terms, once in use among blacksmiths in North America, as uncovered by the author during a career of study and research on the subject of blacksmithing."
2007,Still Life with Tobacco: The Archaeological Uses of Dutch Art,"Historical archaeologists often make considerable use of 17th-century Dutch still life and genre art to document and interpret material life in the early colonial period. In colonial Chesapeake archaeology, this art has been used to identify artifacts, to reconstruct the material and social contexts in which artifacts were used, and to imagine what the past was like in early Maryland and Virginia. This paper argues for a more critical approach to the use of Dutch art in the interpretation of colonial life by comparing the representations of women smoking tobacco in Dutch art with archaeological evidence of women’s tobacco consumption at early domestic Chesapeake sites. Although smoking by women is rarely depicted in Dutch art, archaeological data indicate that Chesapeake women regularly consumed tobacco. Museum representations of early colonial women, which also draw heavily on Dutch art in their depictions of the colonial past, rarely show tobacco smoking. These representations and the archaeological evidence raise important questions about the relationship between artistic and archaeological context and about social attitudes concerning tobacco use in the 17th and the 21st centuries."
2007,Corporeal Concerns: Eighteenth-Century Casta Paintings and Colonial Bodies in Spanish Texas,"Eighteenth-century casta paintings from northern New Spain depict the ethnic and racial combinations resulting from mestizaje, such as mulatto. Casta paintings offer rich insights on the quotidian practices of colonial individuals, including dress, diet, and household practices; this is information that archaeologists desire. Experiences, however, often differed drastically from the world represented in images as individuals reworked colonial categories in identity formation. These paintings represent a static image of a supposedly highly structured and regulated colonial world that was imposed on colonial peoples through their bodies. Visual and archaeological evidence provide different stories, drawn from official versions and lived experiences. Casta paintings, ethnohistorical documents, and material culture are used to explore how the imagined, ordered world depicted in casta paintings meshed with daily life in colonial communities in Spanish Texas and the place of the body in the Spanish colonial world."
2007,"“True Portraitures of the Indians, and of Their Own Peculiar Conceits of Dress”: Discourses of Dress and Identity in the Great Lakes, 1830–1850","During the 1830s and 1840s frontier artist George Winter painted the Potawatomi and Miami Indians of the Wabash Valley. Winter’s paintings existed at the intersection of competing colonial discourses. Like many “Indian painters” of his time, Winter believed he was capturing the final images of a vanishing race. At the same time, Winter’s work runs counters to the imagery of “nakedness” and “savagery” that characterize many Anglo-American paintings of Native Americans during this period. By holding these visual sources in “productive tension” (Stahl 2001:15–16) with documentary and archaeological sources, the role dress played in the construction of identity by members of Great Lakes fur trade society during the 19th century can be unraveled."
2007,The Archaeological Gaze: Surveying the Landscape of Social Power in Portraiture in Colonial New England,"Portraiture, particularly of family scenes, can be seen as a collaboration, perhaps even a conspiracy (in the best sense of the word), between the artist and the sitters in the attempt to preserve a moment, not necessarily a photo-realistic record of persons and artifacts but a reflection of aspirations and real social achievement. While social interaction in the polite world might be seen as fleeting, guided improvisation, portraits self-consciously fix a more permanent impression: spaces, artifacts, and personal posture are carefully chosen to convey a sense of status and power. In the abstract, the organization of human bodies and artifacts in a domestic space is often indicative of individual and family power; in the material world, objects ranging from room decor to the sitters’ adornments are much more personal statements of power and identity within (and beyond) the household. The portraiture of the merchant class of England and her American colonies is considered here."
2007,Fixing Farms: Pondering Farm Scenes from the Vanity Press,"Historical archaeologists are familiar with the illustrated farm views found in late-19th-century local history publications. Analysis of the farm views from the town of Hector in Schuyler County, New York, shows that they do not simply represent the wealthiest farmers or earliest settlers, but they do seem to cluster in family groups of fairly prosperous families representing the second generation of the area’s second wave of settlement. The drawings are accurately rendered in terms of the house and the spatial layout of the farms, but topographical features are generally more mythic. This indicates that the buildings were meant to be recognized from the drawings, probably by people who already knew them. The family relationships connect these separate, individual drawings into nodes within a larger community network."
2007,"Mapped Landscapes: The Politics of Metaphor, Knowledge, and Representation on Nineteenth-Century Irish Ordnance Survey Maps","Historical archaeologists routinely use historical maps in their interpretations of the past. Nineteenth-century Ordnance Survey maps of Ireland illustrate that maps are simultaneously document, artifact, and metaphor. These colonial maps, which shape understanding of the sociohistorical period, are used as “snapshot” documents of the past to complement the archaeological record. Maps as documents control the knowledge of the landscape and so are often used as a metaphor of that control and power. Historical maps serve better with the recognition that they, too, are artifacts. As visual representations of landscapes, thinking about maps as artifacts highlights maps as the sites of contestation and negotiation, visually representing the social relations of power and the contesting of different understandings of landscapes."
2007,Imaging the Scottish Highlands,"Illustrations of 18th-, 19th-, and early-20th-century settlements and people in the Highlands of Scotland structure images of rural life in these areas. Published illustrations often emphasize the poverty, isolation, and hardship of Highland rural life, and these themes are mirrored in many historical and archaeological accounts of the period. Popular literature, in particular literature about the Highland clearances, also emphasizes hardship and powerlessness. These photographs, documents, and accounts interact in constructing a particular kind of Highland past, and a simplified set of power relations, that may not adequately examine the complexities of rural life. By integrating an analytical study of images with a study of reminiscences and of archaeological remains, the historical relationships that produced them may be better understood."
2007,Images of the Holy Land: The David Roberts Paintings as Artifacts of 1830s Palestine,"Historical archaeology is delineating the impact of Western European influence and imperialism on the Middle East, particularly the period the Ottoman Empire ruled over the eastern Mediterranean (1516–1917). Material assemblages from the Ottoman period illustrate the global connections that entangled the eastern Mediterranean with Western European capitalism after the 16th century. Other categories of material culture illustrate such global interactions: the accounts of travelers to the Holy Land in the form of books, paintings, and photographs. These accounts have been understood as part of the Western domination of the Middle East. Orientalist paintings as artifacts of Ottoman Palestine are the focus here, complex interventions in the assumptions about the Holy Land that can be appropriated for archaeological understandings of Palestine’s past. The paintings of landscape artist David Roberts (1796–1864) are used as an example. He traveled through Palestine in the late 1830s and created an unparalleled collection of images."
2006,Ethnoarchaeology of Subsistence Behaviors within a Rural African American Community: Implications for Interpreting Vertebrate Faunal Data from Slave Quarters Areas of Antebellum Plantation Sites,"Ethnoarchaeological observations of the subsistence activities practiced by an African American community in rural southern Mississippi were used to interpret the subsistence behaviors of African Americans within the slave quarters area at Saragossa Plantation, Natchez, Mississippi. Ethnoarchaeological data collected within the community included observations of modifications to bones (during butchery, secondary processing, cooking, and postdisposal activities) and the spatial distribution of subsistence behaviors and bone refuse that resulted from these activities. These data were compared to the faunal assemblages recovered from two former cabins occupied by enslaved African Americans at Saragossa Plantation, which resulted in the identification of several subsistence behaviors at these locations. The current study indicates that data obtained through ethnoarchaeological research provides archaeologists with a powerful tool that, when combined with other lines of evidence such as historical documents, can be used to reconstruct the subsistence behaviors of enslaved African Americans at antebellum plantation sites across the Southeast."
2006,Geophysical Exploration for Buried Buildings,"Cellars are usually easy to detect, but wall foundations can be difficult to find. A scatter of rubble in the soil may reveal the former location of a building; buried buildings are most commonly detected this way. It appears that chemical changes to the soil near buildings may also allow the locations of those buildings to be estimated; perhaps these buildings may be located even if no artifacts or features remain. Auxiliary features, such as buried roads, paths, wells, or privies, may suggest that a building was once nearby. An appraisal of several dozen geophysical surveys suggests that they have had a 50% chance of locating buildings."
2006,Bush Hill: Material Life at a Working Plantation,"Bush Hill plantation, located near Aiken, South Carolina, and Augusta, Georgia, along the middle Savannah River valley, was owned by four generations of the George Bush lineal family between ca. 1807 and 1920. Drawing upon the interpretive concept of the working plantation, perceptions regarding material conditions and the standard of living experienced by southern planters are explored in this essay. Economic records indicate that the George Bush family was among the top wealth-holding groups within the surrounding community. Although the planter family was affluent, the standard of living revealed archaeologically was economically conservative. The Bush family used inexpensive household items and did not acquire the luxury goods often thought to be archaeological hallmarks of genteel society, such as expensive dining sets or tea ware. Conversely, archaeological data revealed they were aggressive consumers, indicated by the sheer quantity of material discarded at the site. The example provided by Bush Hill underscores the complexity of planter households in the past and illustrates that the wealth held by former site residents is not always directly discernable in the archaeological record."
2006,The Abandoned Ships’ Project: An Overview of the Archaeology of Deliberate Watercraft Discard in Australia,"The Abandoned Ships’ Project (ASP) was a research initiative of the Department of Archaeology at Flinders University, South Australia, and carried out in conjunction with the doctoral research of one of the authors (Richards 2002). The project involved the compilation of a database of more than 1,500 discarded and partly dismantled watercraft sites, including information from the archaeological inspection of more than 120 deliberately discarded ships. Researchers used this data to assess the degree of correlation between discard activities and economic, social, and technological issues. The logistics of discard were also examined as reflected in commentaries describing discard processes and as seen in the archaeological signatures of these events. This information illustrated the causal relationships among processes (landscape, economic trends, regulatory frameworks, and cultural site formation) associated with harm minimization, placement assurance, salvage, and discard activities."
2006,"Pigs in Charleston, South Carolina: Using Specimen Counts to Consider Status","A critique of pig use in Charleston, South Carolina, between 1712 and the early 1900s tests the hypothesis that patterns in pig specimen counts from 47 temporal and spatial contexts reflect temporal, functional, and social variables. The study of 2,172 pig specimens indicates that pig use was similar at most sites regardless of function or status. One explanation is that pigs were raised on urban properties, and, after slaughter, their remains were mixed with debris from purchased meats. The greatest variation exists in late-19th-century collections, when most households likely purchased pork. The characteristics found among pig specimens contrast with patterns in cattle specimens; cows and pigs were kept and used differently within Charleston. Zooarchaeological collections from evolving urban settings result from more than one provisioning strategy and encompass a number of interrelated variables. It would be fruitful to examine such collections for evidence of factors in addition to status."
2006,"Feast or Famine? Seventeenth-Century English Colonial Diet at Ferryland, Newfoundland","Documentary and faunal evidence from the 17th-century English colony at Ferryland, Newfoundland, illustrates how the settlers adapted traditional English dietary practices to suit their new situation. The role of both domestic and wild mammals in the diet changed little over the course of the century. Pigs were consistently the most important mammal, supplemented by cattle, sheep/goat, caribou, and seal. The continuity of dietary patterns at the site indicates that the colonists very quickly developed a subsistence regime to maximize fresh meat consumption, given the scheduling demands of the cod fishery and the limitations and potential of the Newfoundland environment."
2006,Genetic Archaeology: The Recovery and Interpretation of Nuclear DNA from a Nineteenth-Century Hypodermic Syringe,"Archaeologists recovered a hard rubber urethral irrigator, glass hypodermic syringe, and six associated copper-alloy needles beneath the charred remains of a small 19th-century home in Virginia City, Nevada. In order to interpret the function and context of the medical paraphernalia, the artifacts were submitted to a forensic laboratory in hopes of recovering historical genomic nuclear human deoxyribonucleic acid and to identify drug residue from the glass syringe using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC/MS). Some of the medical artifacts tested positive for drug residue and human nuclear DNA, thereby demonstrating the ability to successfully obtain chemical and genetic information from artifacts more than 125 years in age. The findings and interpretations illustrate the innovative research potential awaiting archaeologists in the new specialty of genetic archaeology."
2006,"Survival of Biological Evidence on Artifacts: Applying Forensic Techniques at the Boston Saloon, Virginia City, Nevada","The Boston Saloon was an African American-owned business that operated during the 1860s and the 1870s in the mining boomtown of Virginia City, Nevada. Most materials recovered from this establishment are similar to artifacts from other Virginia City saloons due to the widespread availability of mass-produced items. This challenges any attempt at investigating relationships between gender and ethnicity from saloon artifacts. Cooperative efforts between forensic sciences and historical archaeological studies provide a solid foundation for developing unequivocal interpretations of these topics by extracting DNA from common, mass-produced artifacts. Specifically, these efforts resulted in the retrieval of a DNA profile from a clay tobacco pipe stem. Choosing the pipe stem and other likely candidates that could have served as material hosts for ancient DNA (in this case, at least 125 years in age) was a learning process, the results of which may require archaeologists to modify standard recovery methods so as to maximize information retrieval. This process led to other techniques, such as the use of a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS), to identify residues on artifacts."
2006,Sampling Skeletal Remains for Ancient DNA (aDNA): A Measure of Success,"More than 2,000 samples of human osseous and dental materials drawn from forensic archaeological casework of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command Central Identification Laboratory (CIL) were submitted for mitochondrial DNA testing. Most cases represent unidentified remains of U.S. service personnel from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Ancient DNA sampling technique is discussed in the context of an overall strategy of minimizing the risk of contamination with exogenous DNA. Results achieved through implementation of this strategy are reviewed with the intent of providing historical archaeologists with data to assist them in deciding if human remains should be samples for DNA analyses and, if so, how to maximize the chances of an interpretable test outcome. Sample mass proved an important determinant of probability of successful DNA testing. Skeletal element sampled was also a determinant of success rate, independent of sample mass. Femora, tibiae, mandibles, and first metatarsals were excellent sample sources. Cranial samples had low rates of DNA recovery. Climate of deposition and recovery had a minor effect on success rate with temperate recoveries outperforming tropical recoveries in DNA testing success rates. Contrary to initial expectations, older samples performed better than younger samples. This inverse age effect is attributed to conflict-specific taphonomic processes. The lack of any detectable effect over the past 60 years suggests that as long as bones are well preserved and optimal elements well represented, aDNA testing will be relatively unproblematic over time spans of hundreds of years, certainly encompassing the entire time span considered by historical archaeologists."
2006,"Search for the Grave of William Preston Longley, Hanged Texas Gunfighter","William Preston Longley was one of the most notorious outlaws in Texas when he was finally tracked down, arrested, and convicted for shooting a boyhood friend. Since he had cheated death before, contemporaries easily believed Longley’s hanging in October 1878 was a hoax that allowed him to live and raise a family in Louisiana under an alias. The ultimate test of the hoax hypothesis would be to find Longley’s grave and expose either his remains or a weighted coffin. In fall 1992 and spring 1994, a team of scientists used electrical resistivity and magnetometer surveys to locate unmarked burials in areas where historical research indicated Longley’s grave may be located. Team members hoped a grainy historic photograph of the marked gravesite could be correlated with a position in the cemetery. The team determined the approximate location of an unmarked grave that could be Longley’s. Excavation uncovered the remains of a tall white male, which fit his description, and artifacts recovered from the grave were consistent with those known to have been buried with Longley. Finally, a mitochondrial DNA comparison with his living maternal relative produced a very high probability match."
2006,Ground-Penetrating Radar Techniques to Discover and Map Historic Graves,"Ground-penetrating radar is a geophysical technique that can be used to identify and map features commonly associated with historic graves, including intact or partially collapsed coffins and vertical shafts. Data are collected by moving radar antennas that transmit pulses of energy into the ground along parallel transects within grids, recording reflections of those pulses from significant discontinuities within the ground. Visual analysis of radar reflection profiles can be used to identify both coffins and the vertical shaft features commonly associated with human burials. Spatial analysis of the reflection amplitudes within a grid consisting of many profiles (when converted to depth using site-specific velocities) produces three-dimensional maps of these burial features. The identification and mapping of graves can identify remains for possible excavation and study, and the results can also be used for statistical and spatial analysis when integrated with historical records. If identified by these methods, previously unidentified graves can be preserved in areas threatened by construction or erosion."
2006,"Skeletal Remains from the Confederate Naval Sailor and Marines’ Cemetery, Charleston, SC","The 1999 burial recovery project at the Confederate Naval Sailor and Marines’ Cemetery (38CH1648), Charleston, South Carolina, provided a rare opportunity for the skeletal analysis of Civil War period remains. Dating from 1861, the cemetery contained the remains of 40 males of European ancestry who are known to have died in southeastern naval hospitals. Five of the men buried at the site are believed to have been the first crew of the H.L. Hunley submarine. In conjunction with historical and archaeological evidence, the presence of skeletal and dental lesions is used to draw conclusions regarding the backgrounds, health and disease experiences, military ranks, and occupational stresses experienced by the naval and marine personnel buried at the site."
2006,The Man in the Iron Coffin: An Interdisciplinary Effort to Name the Past,"The examination of a cast-iron coffin from the Mason family cemetery at Pulaski, Tennessee, offered an exceptional opportunity to study relatively well-preserved human remains, associated artifacts, and the coffin itself. Only a few studies of cast-iron coffins and their contents have incorporated the results of interdisciplinary research in the interpretation of the burial and the remains. The investigation is based on the use of an evolving protocol that promotes the collection of relevant information from several disciplines when evaluating cast-iron coffins and their contents. Multiple lines of evidence identify the remains as those of Isaac Newton Mason, a private in the First Tennessee Confederate Cavalry Regiment, and provide a detailed and intimate glimpse into the past."
2006,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Bioarchaeology and the Modern Gun Culture Debate","In his controversial book Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture, historian Michael A. Bellesiles argued that personal gun ownership was uncommon prior to 1850. His book triggered an intense re-examination of the American gun culture. A subsequent investigation into his alleged misuse of antebellum probate records to support his thesis resulted in his forfeiture of the prestigious Bancroft Prize and the loss of his position at Emory University. Historical archaeologists can contribute to the debate on the popularity of guns in early America armed with objective data on the frequency and distribution of gun-related artifacts. Analysis of historic period human remains provides another dimension to the modern gun-culture debate through documentation of the prevalence of gunshot wounds, including those among minority groups whose rates of firearms trauma were generally unreported in official statistics before the 1930s. By accurately recognizing and systematically recording gunshot wounds among historical population samples, bioarchaeologists are uniquely positioned to report the actual frequency and, in many cases, the contexts within which such wounds occurred in the past."
2006,Uncapped Potential: Applying Firearms Identification Procedures in the Analysis of Percussion Caps,"Firearms identification procedures continue to play a role in the archaeological study of battles and warfare. Percussion caps, if well preserved, have the potential to yield unique individual tool marks that can be microscopically examined to determine a minimum number of weapons present at a specific site. This study analyzed 110 percussion caps from an 1854 U.S. Army and Apache battle site and determined that at least 34 firearms were used in the battle. A validation study using modern percussion caps from 11 known weapons was also undertaken to demonstrate the potential for percussion cap analysis in future studies."
2006,Metal Tools and the Transformation of an Oceanic Exchange System,"The introduction of European technologies transformed some key aspects of traditional Pacific Island lifeways and exchange systems. One of the most dramatic changes was the replacement of shell and stone tools with those made from iron. As European explorers and traders ventured throughout Micronesia, metal commodities became highly sought after by indigenous peoples. An example of metal tools replacing traditional technologies is presented to explain how this culture contact ultimately changed one of the most famous exchange systems in the Pacific—the quarrying of stone money by Yapese Islanders in the Palau archipelago. The first iron tools ever found in excavation at a stone money quarry site are discussed in relation to their role in changing this unique interisland exchange system during the 18th and 19th centuries."
2006,Symbolic Violence and Landscape Pedagogy: An Illustration from the Irish Countryside,"Archaeologists know that landscapes can provide powerful clues about past social interaction. Landscapes are never truly passive because they offer many socially relevant services to the individuals and social groups who inhabit them. Much of what landscapes do is symbolic. Pedagogy can constitute an important function of a landscape, particularly in the hierarchical societies investigated by historical archaeologists. The demesne constitutes an especially evocative pedagogic landscape in an Irish setting. A detailed examination of Coopershill demesne in County Sligo, Ireland, demonstrates the power of landscape pedagogy and the role of symbolic violence in helping to shape it."
2006,The Color Purple: Dating Solarized Amethyst Container Glass,"From the late-19th century on, there was an increased production of colorless bottles for a wide variety of products. Producing colorless glass is not difficult if pure sand with a very low iron content is available. Iron in sand gives the glass a range of colors from light green to dark amber, depending on the amount of iron in the sand. To overcome this problem, some factories that used iron-bearing sands added manganese to their batch as a decolorizer. While this produces colorless glass, that glass will turn a light purple or amethyst color when it is exposed to sunlight. Dating of solarized glass by archaeologists has relied on information from a variety of sources, including books produced by bottle collectors. Some of this information is good and some of it, erroneous. The objective here is to provide a useful chronology of the development and use of manganese as a decolorizer and to dispel some of the myths that have crept into the literature."
2006,"Churches as Catholic Burial Places: Excavations at the San Francisco Church, Venezuela","In Venezuela and in other Latin American countries, little information exists on burial practices at churches used to dispose of the dead. New data has been obtained on burials and underground funerary structures found during limited excavations of the church of the colonial Franciscan convent of Nuestra Señora de la Salceda of Coro, Venezuela, occupied during the period 1620–1920. Some burials within the church could date as early as the first half of the 18th century, and individuals continued to be interred within the church through the early-20th century. Types of burials and their treatment are described."
2006,"Envisioning Utopia: Transcendentalist and Fourierist Landscapes at Brook Farm, West Roxbury, Massachusetts","Brook Farm, Massachusetts, is perhaps the most famous of the 19th-century utopian communities in America. When it was founded in 1841, its guiding vision was provided by the distinctive New England philosophy known as Transcendentalism. Yet, only three years later, in 1844, it publicly embraced Fourierism and became known as the Brook Farm Phalanx. Archaeological work is providing new information on how these ideologies were inscribed in the landscape, showing that the architectural features built during the Transcendentalist period helped create certain habits of thought and action that actively resisted the complete transition from Transcendentalism to Fourierism."
2006,"Social Status and Landscape in a Nineteenth-Century Planned Industrial Alternative Community: Archaeology and Geography of Feltville, New Jersey","Feltville is located in Union County, New Jersey. This small-scale planned industrial village was designed and operated by David Felt, a liberal Unitarian printer and stationer, from 1845 to 1860. Archaeological and documentary materials recovered over the last six years paint a picture of conditions in Felt’s rural industrial reformist alternative and provide a glimpse into the worldview of the community architect. Examination of Feltville and its historical context allows for the evaluation of the potential practical and theoretical contributions of historical archaeology in the study of utopian movements. Specifically, the diversity of sociopolitical ideals expressed prior to the advent of Marxian socialism calls into question the conflation of communalist and utopian social designs in some contemporary treatments."
2006,"The Ties That Bind: Ideology, Material Culture, and the Utopian Ideal","Communitarian or utopian societies are ideal settings for investigating the interaction between material culture and ideology. Community members deliberately incorporated ideologies of social reform into the planning and organization of their society. Material culture served as an active medium to both reflect and reinforce utopian ideals, and community members were often keenly aware of the symbolic meanings represented in artifacts. In this way, material culture can be seen as simultaneously constituted and constitutive as well as a central focus in maintaining social cohesion. This article examines one such group, the Oneida Perfectionists, that created a socially and financially stable community that endured for more than 30 years. Their use of material culture purposefully reflected their religious ideology and functioned as a means of fostering and maintaining communitas."
2006,"The Quaker Burying Ground in Alexandria, Virginia: A Study of Burial Practices of the Religious Society of Friends","The values of humility and simplicity are two central tenets of the members of the Religious Society of Friends that set them apart from the rest of society. Adherence to these tenets by Alexandria Quakers living in the 18th and 19th centuries is evidenced in the archaeological investigation of the old Quaker Burying Ground in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. In preparation for the construction of a library addition on the cemetery property, City of Alexandria archaeologists conducted excavations in 1993 to 1995 and identified 159 burial features, 66 of which were excavated. Although preservation of the remains was poor, information on interment practices, coffin types, burial goods, and health was recovered. Analysis of the Quaker Burying Ground data and comparisons with other historical cemetery excavations suggest that Alexandria’s Quaker community largely rejected the ostentatious burial rituals, known as the “beautification of death” movement, of the dominant culture."
2006,Representing Utopia: The Case of Cyrus Teed’s Koreshan Unity Settlement,"In the late-19th century, impelled by a dissatisfaction with American “competist” values and inspired by a vision of cosmic truth, Dr. Cyrus Teed, known as Koresh, left Chicago with a small group of followers to build their New Jerusalem in the swamplands of Estero Bay, Florida. The central tenet of Koreshanity was that the earth is a hollow sphere, and we live on the inside. This conception of the universe encouraged a theology, political science, and philosophical understanding that stressed the finite, knowable, and internally complete nature of the world. The history and material remains of the Koreshan community are discussed, and the article ends with some reflections on how their utopian project has been, and should be, represented in a modern context. There are political implications in what is chosen to be said or left unsaid about dissenting groups like the Koreshans."
2006,"Archaeological Identification of an Idiosyncratic Lifestyle: Excavation and Analysis of the Theosophical Society Dump, San Diego, California","Refuse deposited by members of the Theosophical Institute in San Diego, California, ca. 1900–1920 provides a basis for defining patterns that reflect the idiosyncratic lifeways of the people who lived there. Comparisons with assemblages from urban and rural sites of the same period allow isolation of the areas of divergence. The Theosophical Society assemblage has low proportions of consumer items and bottled products along with lower values for ceramic tableware price scaling. Dietary differences were noted, as well, and the refuse has a large number of homeopathic medicine vials, reflecting specialized health practices. The patterns noted indicate less than full participation in the consumer society of the time and deviations in diet and healing practices from those of the mainstream society, and may have served as boundary markers, reinforcing the sense of group membership and cohesiveness."
2006,Doukhobor Identity and Communalism at Kirilovka Village Site,"In early 1899, a migration of more than 7,000 Russian immigrants belonging to the Christian sect known as the Doukhobors arrived in western Canada and established three colonies in the districts of Saskatchewan and Assiniboia in the Northwest Territories. Due to internal tensions in the sect and conflicts with the Government of Canada’s Department of the Interior, most of these villages were abandoned by 1920. Previous historical characterizations of the Doukhobors in Saskatchewan are inconsistent in their portrayal of the Doukhobors as an ethnic group and/or religious sect, and of the degree of internal cohesion and homogeneity at the community level. Combined archaeological and historical investigations suggest that the Doukhobor identity in Saskatchewan involves multiple levels of practice and belief. Further, Doukhobor identity is characterized by constant change brought about by repeated migrations through two centuries."
2006,Between Vision and Practice: Archaeological Perspectives on the Llano del Rio Cooperative,"Ideology is perhaps nowhere more patently visible in the archaeological record than at utopian communities. While ideology informs all human action, the tenets of utopian ventures operate on a more fully conscious level than those underlying mainstream culture. The deliberate use of symbolism is a hallmark of the way utopians sought to define themselves and their visions. By comparing these utopian visions with the actual practices of such groups, archaeologists can deepen understandings of the challenges and lessons evolving from the pursuit of such experiments. Recent archaeological investigations at the Llano del Rio Cooperative are used to explore these issues. Socialists established the Llano cooperative near Los Angeles in 1914 as an act of political and economic resistance to the growth of industrial capitalism. There, the colonists sought to create a self-sufficient, secular, egalitarian community that would demonstrate a viable alternative to capitalistic exploitation."
2006,A Feminist Theoretical Approach to the Historical Archaeology of Utopian Communities,"A feminist approach provides new insights into the significant impacts of utopian gender ideologies and practices on the transformation of American culture from the 19th century into the 20th century. First, the context in which utopian gender ideologies developed is discussed, including married women’s lack of rights and alternative philosophies and ideologies. An archaeological framework is then developed for assessing the major issue of the degree of communalism vs. familism practiced in utopian communities compared with documented ideology. Archaeological data can provide new insights into the degree of material implementation of utopian gender ideologies concerning cooperative housekeeping and related sexual arrangements. Archaeology can also contribute data on the extent of adoption in the wider culture of utopian cooperative housekeeping enterprises and accompanying inventions."
2005,Fashionable and Work Shoes from a Nineteenth-Century Boston Privy,"In 1993 excavation of a privy at 27/29 Endicott Street in Boston, Massachusetts, yielded fragments of fashionable and work shoes dating from the 1850s to the 1880s. During these years, two household types lived at the house: all females, some of whom may have been prostitutes, from the 1850s to 1867; and a doctor and his family from 1867 to the 1880s. Three shoe features provide clues about shoe construction and the wearers’ class, gender, and occupation: (1) construction methods, apparent in the soles; (2) style, most evident in shoe uppers; and (3) size. Artifacts provide new evidence of a rand, a shoe part found in the sole."
2005,Public Dialectics: Marxist Reflection in Archaeology,"The public dimensions of archaeological practice are explored through a new method called Marxist reflexivity. This use for Marxism draws a parallel with recent reflexive archaeologies that highlight the impact of archaeologists and archaeological processes on the creation of archaeological records. Though similar in this sense of critique, reflexive and Marxist archaeologies do not often overlap, as each is essentially driven by a distinct agenda and logic. Through a critical review of four public programs undertaken in historical archaeology, this distinction is disassembled."
2005,"Target Architecture of a Suspected Firing Range at Fort Fred Steele, Wyoming","Field survey and artifact recovery revealed several features with high concentrations of cartridge cases and fired bullets at Fort Fred Steele, Wyoming. The bullet concentrations surround four large piles of river cobbles and associated wood fragments. Later research suggested the features represent two distinct firing range complexes, each comprised of multiple target positions and at least one firing position. The cobble piles and wood are believed to be remains of target markers’ shelters. Feature SC-2 provides significant evidence supporting this hypothesis but appears to exhibit an atypical style of architecture. Historical investigation validates Feature SC-2’s geographic location, while artifact analysis dates the feature to the period of Fort Fred Steele’s military occupation. An in-situ fired bullet in direct contact with wooden architecture, a brief metal-detecting survey, and a firing range model further corroborate the identification of Feature SC-2 as a target marker’s shelter on an established firing range."
2005,Space and Structure at an Australian Timber Camp,"Remote timber camps were common in Australian forests and woodlands during the 19th and early-20th centuries. They usually featured accommodation, a boarding house for meals, and a tramline to connect the sawmill and camp to the outside world. Henry’s No.1 Mill was typical of such places. It operated between 1904 and 1927 in the Otway Ranges, southwest of Melbourne. Survey and excavation of the site in 1997 and 1998 yielded evidence of architectural layout and consumption practices. Spatial analysis of the mill examines the structure and pattern of housing, the nature and distribution of amenities, and movement between the site and nearby townships. Workers and residents were both isolated from and integrated with the wider world, continually negotiating the use of space within their homes, around the camp, and beyond."
2005,"Faith and Practice at an Early-Eighteenth-Century Wampanoag Burial Ground: The Waldo Farm Site in Dartmouth, Massachusetts","Recent archaeological interpretations of colonial Native American cemeteries in southeastern New England typically focus on the interplay of resistance and accommodation and creative reimagining of Native practices in the face of Anglo-American oppression. Resistance is tracked primarily via “traditional” mortuary ceremonialism. The Waldo Farm cemetery in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, is unlike any other archaeologically known colonial Native burial ground in the region. Native burial practices there seem indistinguishable from local Anglo-American practices. How may one approach the interpretation of such a site? Postcolonial concepts such as hybridization, mimicry, and appropriation, which emphasize the interdependence of domination and resistance, are used. The local cultural context, especially the religious context, of the Waldo site may explain mortuary choices there."
2005,"Unfired Brandon Gunflints from the Presidio Santa María de Galve, Pensacola, Florida","A cache of 1,239 unfired Brandon gunflints was recovered at the Presidio Santa María de Galve site in Pensacola, Florida. Composed of both gray spall and blade gunflints, this assemblage is unique in terms of its size and the fact that none of the gunflints showed evidence of firing or reworking. Although precise dating of the cache based on documentary, archaeological, and internal gunflint data is problematic, it is believed to have originated in the early-19th century. This mint-condition assemblage provides a rare opportunity to explore the dimensional characteristics of historic English gunflints before they were subjected to the reduction processes of firing and resharpening. Descriptive data are presented and compared with other gunflint collections, and the significance of the formal and temporal characteristics of this assemblage is discussed."
2005,"Material Expressions of Social Inequality on a Porfirian Sugar Hacienda in Yucatán, Mexico","Power relations intrinsic to the institution of debt peonage clearly influenced material conditions on the haciendas of Yucatán prior to the Mexican Revolution. Recent investigations at a late-19th- and early-20th-century sugar hacienda explore the material basis for its relations of production. The evidence indicates that hacienda owners divided the indebted workforce and then provided a select group of laborers with privileged access to material resources. Vernacular architecture, settlement layout, and the distribution of imported ceramics all signify social inequality within the labor force. Material disparities on the estate suggest a negotiation of power through the exchange of rewards for the loyalties of a managerial class. Moreover, the inequalities may have accentuated a social order perceived by Yucatecan elites, while inhibiting indebted class solidarity."
2005,"Perspective and Surveillance in Eighteenth-Century Maryland Gardens, Including William Paca’s Garden on Wye Island","Since 1981, 18th-century formal gardens and landscapes in Annapolis have been archaeologically explored to demonstrate that they are exercises in using solid geometry to control perspective. Building on this earlier work, William Paca’s last garden, built on Wye Island in the late 1700s, is interpreted to explore the methods by which these gardens were constructed and the meanings and uses of the gardens. Scholars have suggested that by the 1720s the genteel in America routinely created gardens as extensions of their homes. The desire to manage the views in gardens is in the application of the laws of geometry to wilderness. It is suggested that these ordered landscapes, as centerpieces of leisure in the midst of the working plantation and as places to display oneself to visitors and workers alike, were also consonant with slaveholder ideology and the ideals of the new republic."
2005,"The Material Culture of an Industrial Artifact: Interpreting Control, Defiance, and Everyday Resistance at the New South Wales Eveleigh Railway Workshops","The Eveleigh Railway Workshops operated between the 1880s and the late 1980s in Sydney, Australia. Using an interpretive approach and drawing on the concept of the cultural landscape, the relationship between the spatial arrangement of Eveleigh’s nonportable structures, its operations management strategies, and the material-cultural practices of its employees are investigated. In addition, archival and oral sources are related to the site’s material culture in order to explain how patterns of work and interaction gave rise to discourses and practices of control and defiance. On this basis, attention to such intangible and ephemeral dimensions of the archaeological record as workers’ resistance can provide an effective means for understanding how one group of people actively shaped their physical environment."
2005,Early Pastoral Landscapes and Culture Contact in Central Australia,"The arrival of British pastoralists throughout central Australia from the 1850s marked the introduction of wool production, predominantly for industrialized Britain. Pastoral industries were both capitalist and colonizing enterprises. Archaeological research and historical documents from pastoral station managers reveal how indigenous people were involved in the workings of Strangways Springs Station in northern South Australia (1860–1900). Research reveals differential Aboriginal involvement in the pastoral industry, indicated by two phases in the development of the pastoral station. Changes in pastoral work practice over time influenced cultural interaction."
2005,Mining Landscapes and Colonial Rule in Early-Twentieth-Century Cyprus,"In the early 20th century the large-scale copper and asbestos mines of Cyprus were intimately associated with colonial rule, both in their ideologies and in their actual operations. For the Cypriot miners, this represented a major disruption of long-standing values and required a new negotiation of their relationship with their British colonizers. Attempts to control mining landscapes and communities interplayed with a range of actions from submission to everyday resistance to strikes and riots. These dynamics are most clearly seen by examining the entire landscape. Particularly revealing aspects include the naming of mining landscapes, the surveillance of miners, the complex relationship between mining and agriculture, the actual and symbolic manipulation of artifacts, the expression of control and resistance in miners’ housing, and shifting concepts of community."
2005,The Dynamite Factory: An Industrial Landscape in Late-Nineteenth-Century South Africa,"The development of deep-level mining on the Witwatersrand, South Africa, in the mid-1880s and the concomitant increase in demands for blasting explosives led to the establishment, in 1895, of a dynamite factory at Modderfontein, northeast of Johannesburg. Staffed by laborers drawn from across the African subcontinent and professionals and artisans recruited from established European dynamite factories, the community was highly cosmopolitan in nature, a microcosm of burgeoning Johannesburg. At Modderfontein, however, corporate interpretation of this social diversity was particular. Perceptions of ethnic complexity and their appropriate jointing were seminal in the organizations and mediations of communities and are harnessed in a reading of the landscape. Although premised on European design theories, Modderfontein must be understood as a distinct colonial articulation, a specific late-19th-century interpretation of local and global historical trajectories."
2005,"Creating and Domesticating Hungary’s Socialist Industrial Landscape: From Dunapentele to Sztálinváros, 1950–1958","Eastern Europe’s socialist new cities have been seen as embodying “politicized landscapes”; in other words, landscapes created by socialist dictatorships according to their own ideological purposes. The region’s socialist new cities were indeed identified as distinctively socialist landscapes, but the processes by which they came to be understood as such by the citizens of socialist states were far more complex than top-down accounts allow. The reactions of both builders and residents of the Hungarian new city of Sztálinváros (Stalin City) to the urban form are examined in order to show how the city came to be seen as a distinctively socialist industrial landscape. Employing an approach based on a dialogue between the methods of historical archaeology and social history is employed, demonstrating that an examination of popular responses to material culture can reveal much about state socialism in Eastern Europe and its nature."
2005,Landscapes of Resistance: A View of the Nineteenth-Century Chesapeake Bay Oyster Fishery,"The introduction of industrialized harvesting techniques to the Chesapeake Bay oyster fishery in the 19th century was resisted by communities of oyster tongers who represented traditional fishing methods. Maryland oyster tongers contested the advancement of industrial harvesting through various means. Important to this opposition was the development of an occupational identity that promoted traditional values and fishing practices and rejected wage labor. Natural and cultural landscapes of the working and domestic spheres helped shape and reproduce this occupational identity in part by placing constraints on aspects of the lifeways of oyster tonging communities. Ultimately, these landscapes became emblems of the distinctive life and economic choices of oyster tongers."
2005,"The Landscape of Van Winkle’s Mill: Identity, Myth, and Modernity in the Ozark Upland South","Archaeological investigations at Van Winkle’s Mill (3BE413), a mid-to-late-19th century sawmill in the Arkansas Ozarks, were conducted between October 1997 and October 2003. These investigations yielded information that may help clarify the changing social relations and race constructions associated with the end of the antebellum era as expressed via landscape usage. Additionally, the excavations have much to say regarding our stereotypes of both slavery (and by extension the whole African Diaspora) and the inhabitants of the American upland South."
2005,The Landscape of Iñupiat Eskimo Industrial Labor,"Archaeological data from excavations at a north Alaskan commercial shore whaling station and documentary information are used to trace the development of an Iñupiat Eskimo labor force in the western Arctic commercial whaling industry in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. For nearly a thousand years, I ñupiat have been communal hunters of the bowhead whale. American commercial whalers arrived at Point Barrow in 1854 and in 1888 began hiring Eskimos to staff the whaling stations as wage labor. The material remuneration for labor enabled many Eskimo commoners to strive for the otherwise unattainable high-status role of traditional umialik. This initial commoditization of Eskimo labor in the western Arctic saw an incorporation of two distinctive landscapes: one indigenous and Iñupiat, the other introduced and Euroamerican. These landscapes had some overlap, but were not at all coterminous; each had its own origins and means and ends, its own raison d’etre."
2005,Health and Disease in Nineteenth-Century San Francisco: Skeletal Evidence from a Forgotten Cemetery,"Burials from the Legion of Honor cemetery provide osteological evidence of the living conditions experienced by economically disadvantaged people who died in San Francisco during the last half of the 19th century. Comparisons suggest their lives were similar to those of other lower-class 19th-century Americans. Rapid population growth, overcrowded housing, sanitation problems, and water contamination probably contributed to the shared disease patterns seen in urban areas throughout the United States in the mid-19th century. Some significant population differences, however, do exist. The relatively high frequency of enamel hypoplasia in the Legion of Honor population may be attributed to conditions unique to San Francisco’s urban poor as well as to the stressful conditions the city’s immigrants faced as children in their places of origin. The lower frequency of nasal fractures may be attributed to changing patterns of interpersonal violence associated with the commercialization of boxing during the early-20th century."
2005,Regulars and “Irregulars”: British and Provincial Variability among Eighteenth-Century Military Frontiers,"Historical studies have detailed the joint service of provincial and British regular soldiers during the Seven Years’ War (ca. 1754–1763) in colonial North America. The complex relations between these communities and their effect on the material record of military settlements, however, have not been fully addressed within historical archaeology. An analysis of British and provincial domestic structures at New York military sites employing lead shot and ceramic data reveals small-scale material variation between these two groups. The effect that different scales of analysis will have on the nature of this variation is recognized, and a preliminary spatial model of provincial-British relations is developed. The model assumes significant distinctions will characterize small-scale provincial and British contexts, while larger frames of reference may demonstrate similar or conflicting material patterns based on the historical relationship between the two communities. The context for this analysis is informed by recent critiques of large-scale core/periphery perspectives in the archaeology of frontier settlements."
2005,Eighteenth-Century Redware Folk Terms and Vessel Forms: A Survey of Utilitarian Wares from Southeastern Pennsylvania,"Domestically produced, lead-glazed red earthenwares (or redwares) are among the most frequently recovered artifacts from 18th-century Pennsylvania sites. Utilitarian pottery met the colonial consumer’s need for inexpensive, everyday wares for food preparation, dairying, and tableware. Comparison of two data sources resulted in the organization of an incipient type series for southeastern Pennsylvania redwares. A survey of a variety of primary documents yielded a folk lexicon for some redware vessels. These terms have been tentatively ascribed to reconstructed vessels from six archaeological assemblages from the southeastern Pennsylvania region. A pattern of continuity in a number of vessel forms has also been observed in the redware assemblages analyzed. Prior to the initiation of redware manufacture in America, a flourishing network of commercial trade throughout 17th-century Europe contributed to the ethnic fusion of specific vessel shapes. By the late 1700s, immigrant craftsmen had incorporated these specific vessel shapes into their potting repertoire."
2005,"Excavating the Dugout House of Norwegian Immigrant Anna Byberg Christopherson Goulson, Swift County, Minnesota","This article presents the results of excavations on the dugout house site of Anna Byberg Christopherson Goulson in west-central Minnesota. Anna and Lars Christopherson reportedly moved into their dugout house ca. 1868. With the death of Lars and two of their five children in 1878, Anna married Hans Goulson (who had immigrated to the area from Wisconsin) in 1879. Sometime after the birth of their first child in the dugout in late 1879, Anna and Hans built a small wood-frame house on land located about one-half mile south of the dugout. The dugout house, like the sod house, was a typical solution for providing quick and inexpensive shelter for families settling new farms on the prairie frontier regions of the Upper Midwest. Archaeological investigations identified the Christopherson/Goulson dugout house and documented the belowground architecture of this intriguing structure. While neither the dugout structure nor the artifact assemblage is particularly reflective of the family’s Norwegian heritage, their subsequent ca. 1880 wood-frame house was decorated to reflect their Norwegian roots."
2005,Back to the Bowl: Using English Tobacco Pipebowls to Calculate Mean Site-Occupation Dates,"The form of English white ball-clay pipebowls can be used to determine accurate mean dates for historical contexts. Using previously established bowl seriations and typologies on the well-dated material assemblage uncovered at the site of the 1607 James Fort at Jamestown Island, Virginia, a newly developed calculation proves to be a reliable technique of assessing chronology. Determining the pipebowl mean date involves identifying the shape of each bowl, counting the number of examples of each morphological type, and then completing a series of simple arithmetic calculations. The pipebowl-dating device correlates well with other archaeological lines of evidence. On average, pipebowl mean dates are within seven years of mean dates established by other factors. This method regularly outperforms established pipestem-based mean-date measures."
2005,"Social Flux at the Naval Establishment at Penetanguishene, Lake Huron, 1817–1834","Factors influencing the spatial arrangement of buildings at the Royal Navy establishment at Penetanguishene on Lake Huron are discussed. Excavation at the naval hospital at this site provides new insight into the residential movements of the various social groups at the base. Analysis of stratigraphy and artifacts recovered from the hospital suggests that the assistant naval surgeon and his wife, military officers, and aboriginal people resided in the structure at various times over a 17-year period. Contemporary attitudes toward social and economic status, service rank/rating, and aboriginal people are explored within the context of the archaeological and documentary evidence to explain changes in residential patterning through time."
2005,"Wealthy, Free, and Female: Prostitution in Nineteenth-Century New York","Increasing class consciousness permeated the institution of prostitution in 19th-century New York City. In a Five Points brothel that was closed in 1843, the resident working-class prostitutes manipulated accoutrements of gentility to attract a bourgeois clientele. They used the symbols of middle-class respectability to their own advantage, increasing the value of the commodity they offered for sale and enjoying the comforts that money could buy. The artifacts recovered from the brothel’s privy suggest that when the women were not working they lived no better than their sisters in the tenements. Ceramics and food remains, in particular, fall into two contrasting groups: one that is comparable to the upper middle class and the other that resembles other working-class residents of Five Points. The duality reveals exploitation as well as economic well-being and pain as well as pleasure. Five Points prostitutes may have looked wealthy, free, and female from the outside, but an inside perspective suggests their lives were considerably more complex."
2005,"Babies in the Privy: Prostitution, Infanticide, and Abortion in New York City’s Five Points District","Excavation of a privy shaft associated with a 19th-century tenement at 12 Orange Street in New York City’s Five Points district revealed the skeletal remains of two full-term neonates and a fetus. The well-preserved neonatal remains, probably twins, represent either concealment of a stillbirth or neonaticide, a subtype of infanticide. The presence of the “quickened” fetus in a different privy layer reflects concealment of a miscarriage or an induced abortion. Historical documents indicate that city authorities closed a “disorderly house” or brothel located in the tenement’s cellar in 1843 due to neighbors’ complaints. Within this historical context, the discovery of the skeletal remains provides an opportunity to trace changes in American social and legal attitudes regarding infanticide, abortion, and prostitution and explore the difficult choices faced by working women in New York City from the colonial period to the middle of the 19th century."
2005,Illicit Congress in the Nation’s Capital: The History of Mary Ann Hall’s Brothel,"Mary Ann Hall ran a high-class brothel in Washington, DC, from about 1840 until the 1870s. Located several blocks from the capitol building at 349 Maryland Avenue, it probably served wealthy, well-connected men in the national capital. During the Civil War, it was likely the largest brothel in the city. When Hall died in 1886, she left behind a valuable estate and was buried in Washington’s Congressional Cemetery. Intensive background research uncovered documentary evidence that sheds light on this high-class brothel as well as on prostitution in general in Washington, DC, during the 19th century. Sources included census records, city directories, tax assessments, deeds, maps, historic photographs and prints, police precinct records, historic newspapers, and several unique 19th-century and contemporary publications on prostitution in general and Washington, DC, scandals. Especially enlightening sources were a series of newspaper articles detailing Mary Ann Hall’s 1864 indictment for keeping a bawdy house and a collection of papers in the District of Columbia Archives documenting the legal battle among Hall’s heirs for her estate. The latter includes a room-by-room inventory made in 1886 that reveals the contents of the house where Hall ran her brothel."
2005,Mary Ann Hall’s House,"Archaeological data recovery investigations were conducted at the site of the new National Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall in Washington, DC. Investigations included excavations on two lots, one that included Mary Ann Hall’s mid-19th-century brothel and the adjacent lot that included deposits associated with the brothel’s occupation. The archaeological record complemented the historical record, confirming that the brothel was a high-class establishment. The brothel’s 1860s deposits yielded evidence of expensive ceramics, champagne, and a wide variety of foods. Comparison of the artifact assemblage from Hall’s brothel with mid-19th-century family households in Washington, DC, supports the interpretation that the brothel purchased expensive consumer goods. Comparison of Hall’s brothel with other brothel assemblages in Washington, DC, revealed no simple brothel artifact signature but illustrated economic-status differences among the brothels."
2005,Public Image and Private Reality: An Analysis of Differentiation in a Nineteenth-Century St. Paul Bordello,"In spring 1 997, during preparation for construction of the new Science Museum of Minnesota, the brothel of an infamous St. Paul madam and other “boardinghouses” were uncovered. This archaeological area was designated the Washington Street District. Subsequent data recovery revealed a wealth of archaeological data that contradicted official government documents and addressed some of the many myths and legends surrounding Nina Clifford’s bordello. Differences between the artifacts used by the customers and the residents are apparent in vessel types, faunal remains, and other artifact types. Conclusions reflect the relationship between the brothel’s public image and the reality of the day-to-day lives of the residents. The preponderance of the archaeological evidence for poor health conditions of the residents contradicts the myths of the glamorous sporting life of Nina Clifford’s establishment. While the women may have enjoyed higher incomes and better food, it was at a high price."
2005,Brothels and Saloons: An Archaeology of Gender in the American West,"An analysis of eight artifact collections from mining-related communities in the North American West sheds light on the manifestation of gender in the archaeological record. Saloons and brothels served similar functions in the mining boom-towns, often overlapping. A critical difference between the two types of collections lies in who was selecting the material culture: men or women. Women’s contributions to the archaeological assemblages of sporting establishments can be identified by items specific to them, as well as by relatively high percentages of pharmaceuticals. High frequencies of armaments and generic personal items in the brothels may have more to do with the specific activities taking place in the brothels than with gender. The importance of distinguishing between the brothels and saloons is examined in the context of feminist theory."
2005,"City of Angels, City of Sin: Archaeology in the Los Angeles Red-Light District ca. 1900","In June 1996, archaeological excavations at the Union Station in downtown Los Angeles uncovered a portion of the city’s former red-light district. The district thrived from the 1870s until a reform government closed it down in 1909. A six-seat privy complex associated with a parlor house (ca. 1880–1901), densely filled with household items, provides insight into life behind the red lights. Domestic deposits from the prostitutes’ neighbors were also recovered, providing comparative collections. Artifact deposits were evaluated in the field to ensure that only those collections with integrity and clear historic associations were brought back to the lab for analysis. Documentary research focused on identifying features associated with specific brothels and households. Artifacts were tabulated using minimum number of item counts, and frequency tables were developed for making meaningful comparisons. Noteworthy contrasts between the prostitutes and their neighbors are found in activities related to the consumption of alcohol and food and to grooming and health."
2005,"Archaeologists in the Brothel: “Sin City,” Historical Archaeology and Prostitution","The essays in this volume contribute to recent historical analysis that rescues prostitution from the literature of deviancy and crime. Prostitutes are not considered “fallen women” but, rather, females who made rational and sometimes desperate choices when confronted with limited possibilities. Furthermore, we now know more not only about the prostitutes themselves (something painfully lacking in the American literature before 1980) but also about the culture and material conditions in which they lived and worked."
2004,North Atlantic Fishes in Inland Context: Pickled Mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in the Historic Period,"Several North Atlantic fish species were salted, pickled, or smoked and widely transported throughout inland North America during the 19th century. Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are among the most frequently referenced in historic accounts. These two are the fishes whose remains are reported most often from 19th-century archaeological contexts. Because mackerel were graded and priced primarily by fork length, they potentially offer a useful means of assessing socioeconomic status. A method for estimating mackerel fork length from remains recovered from archaeological contexts is provided for 10 bones of the mackerel skeleton. Bulk fine-screening of at least some deposits containing human food refuse is recommended to guard against recovery bias of remains from higher priced, larger mackerel."
2004,Household Succession as a Catalyst of Landscape Change,"Most residences excavated by historical archaeologists were occupied by several households. Consequently, the domestic landscape is a dynamic context that often reflects the occupational history of a former dwelling or houselot. Interestingly, major site events and landscape changes typically coincide with important junctures in the life history of households. Household succession, in which different residents occupy a dwelling, appears to be a significant transition that influences the domestic landscape. Shortly after inhabiting a residence, new occupants may expand a dwelling, move or raze extant outbuildings, alter fence lines, and change the location of refuse disposal areas. In turn, during excavation historical archaeologists are often confronted with a challenging array of features, deposits, and landscape modifications. In this paper, the influence of household succession upon landscape change is explored through consideration of several sites that collectively were occupied between the 17th and 20th centuries. The study sites illustrate that household succession is an important catalyst of landscape change. Consequently, the archaeological record at residences can be better contextualized and interpreted through the use of this concept."
2004,Labor’s Heritage: Remembering the American Industrial Landscape,"Archaeology at industrial sites provides some of the greatest opportunities to tell the story of the impact of industrialization on workers and their communities. Archaeologists working on industrial sites have a long tradition of interpreting technology and industrial landscapes while issues related to labor are overlooked or glossed over. Other historical archaeologists have laid the groundwork for understanding labor relations and daily life in industrial contexts. An overview of the current state of industrial archaeology is provided, and a renewed call for addressing an archaeology of labor is issued. Work performed at industrial sites needs to address issues related to labor. The draft National Historic Landmark study by the National Park Service on labor archaeology serves as a good framework to deal with these ideas. Additional avenues of inquiry are also explored."
2004,Recent Evidence for Broad Window Glass in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century America,"Window glass is a common artifact found on many historic archaeological sites. Until now, some researchers have believed that crown window glass was used exclusively during the colonial period and early postcolonial period (Tunis 1965; Pepper 1971; Louis Berger and Assoc. 1996; LeeDecker et al. 1997; Bedell et al. 2002). Broad window glass had been assigned a terminus post quem of 1820, eventually replacing crown window glass by around 1840 (Louis Berger and Assoc. 1996). However, recent excavations at the First Baptist Church and Old Scots Meetinghouse sites in Monmouth County, New Jersey, past excavations at St. Mary’s City, Maryland, and historic documentation indicate that broad glass was manufactured and used in America during the colonial period, possibly as early as the 17th century. This paper will examine the production processes for both crown and broad window glass as well as the physical evidence for the use and production of broad window glass alongside crown window glass during the early colonial period."
2004,"Sand Blows Desperately: Land-Use History and Site Integrity at Camp Ford, a Confederate POW Camp in East Texas","Archaeological investigations revealed well-preserved remains of Camp Ford (41SM181), an East Texas Civil War site where Confederate guards held up to 4,800 Union prisoners of war (POWs) in a stockaded compound on a sandy hillside. The prisoners brought tons of clayey sediment onto the site’s loamy sand soil for construction of houses and as backdirt from refuse pits. Abandoned at war’s end and probably salvaged for useable logs, Camp Ford became farmland, ultimately a pine-tree farm. Among identified subsurface features were stockade-wall trenches, refuse pits, dugouts, and clay-lined cabin floors. Trenches and pits in the sandy solum typically exhibited remarkably abrupt boundaries with the surrounding subsoil, in contrast to markedly less distinctive feature boundaries encountered at most sandy-landform sites in the region. Good preservation conditions resulted in large measure from postwar development of a clay-rich B horizon (Bt) and lamellae (thin clayey bands), which retarded eluviation in the underlying 2Eb horizon and thereby preserved feature boundaries."
2004,E. C. Waters and Development of a Turn-of-the-Century Tourist Economy in Yellowstone National Park,"After designation as the world’s first national park in 1872, Yellowstone became a popular turn-of-the-century tourist destination. In response to increasing numbers of tourists, a unique maritime system developed on Yellowstone Lake, culminating with tour vessel E. C. Waters’ launch in 1905. The National Park Service’s Submerged Resources Center 1996 archaeological investigations in Yellowstone National Park focused on the 125 ft.-long wooden-hulled screw steamer E. C. Waters’ remains and other elements of Yellowstone Lake’s tourist infrastructure. Yellowstone National Park’s tourist development is examined in a world system framework, linking developments on Yellowstone Lake to late-19th-century western tourism and industrial capitalist expansion. The E. C. Waters site (48YE13) is interpreted as part of a regional maritime system."
2004,Introduction: Presidios of the North American Spanish Borderlands,"Presidios were an important part of the Spanish colonial system. In general, they were fortified settlements with an assigned military contingent. Presidios exhibited a wide range of variation as they adapted to local needs, materials, and populations. Historical and archaeological information from eight presidios in the North American Spanish Borderlands from San Francisco to St. Augustine are summarized. They provide much new information about presidios as a distinctive type of settlement and on the development of Hispanic frontier culture. This publication marks the beginning of bringing North American borderland presidios into the mainstream of historical archaeology. The presidio was an important frontier settlement of the Spanish frontier, and their residents were the frontline of acculturation. Cultural and biological hybrids developed at presidios and became the foundation for a significant part of modern-day culture in the southern half of the United States."
2004,The Evolution of the Presidio in Northern New Spain,"Between 1550 and 1848, approximately 200 presidios were established on the northwestern frontier of Hispanic civilization in North America. Over time, the institution evolved from small garrisoned places into a distinctive type of military colony. Prior to 1750, many presidios were not fortified. Those that were reflected vernacular building traditions that echoed medieval models. During the last 100 years of Spanish rule, efforts were made to modernize the presidios and professionalize their garrisons. These projects were only partially successful. Despite increasingly limited resources, portions of the presidio system managed to survive into the middle of the 19th century."
2004,The Presidio System in Spanish Florida 1565–1763,"The Spanish founded at least 16 presidios in Florida, the first at San Agustín in 1565 and the last in Pensacola in 1756. Until 1698, there were no presidios west of the Apalachicola River. Beginning in that year and continuing into the early-18th century, the Spanish founded multiple presidios at Pensacola Bay and at St. Joseph’s Bay. When the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in the Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years’ War and exchanged all of Florida for Havana, only three presidios remained: San Agustín, Pensacola, and San Marcos."
2004,La Ciudad de San Agustín: A European Fighting Presidio in Eighteenth-Century La Florida,"Spain’s claim to La Florida during the 18th century depended on its ability to maintain control of its capital, San Agustín. To ensure that the city survived the onslaughts of English-led or English-supported excursions, the Spanish erected an elaborate defense system. The system consisted of forts, earthen lines and bastions, blockhouses, sentry lookouts, and Native American and African perimeter settlements. The cornerstone of the colonial-walled city was Castillo de San Marcos. Historical events are used to understand the development of the presidio and how both the built environment of the community and the material culture of its residents were modified as a consequence of military policies and strategies."
2004,Presidio Santa María De Galve (1698–1719): A Frontier Garrison in Spanish West Florida,"Presidio Santa María de Galve was a small but tenacious presidio community established to stop French aggression from Louisiana. While authorized by Spain, this presidio was a colony of New Spain. It was manned with petty criminals from Mexico City, Puebla, and Vera Cruz and teetered on the verge of disaster for most of its existence between 1698 and 1719. As there was no local Indian population to provide support, and the situado was irregular and limited, trade with the French colony at Mobile was the key to survival. The social organization of the community was revealed in the distribution of artifacts and architectural differences. Architectural remains and associated materials were found of the warehouse, three barracks buildings, and one church. Two cemeteries were also located. The stockade fort walls were also found and studied. The artifact assemblage is very different from that of contemporary Presidio San Agustín or Catholic mission settlements as it is dominated by Mexican-made materials with a minority of Indian-made items. The information from Presidio Santa María de Galve in Pensacola has produced much new information and shed new light on the differences between East and West Spanish Florida."
2004,"Presidio Los Adaes: Spanish, French, and Caddoan Interaction on the Northern Frontier","Presidio Los Adaes was the capital of the Spanish Province of Texas for much of the 18th century. Named after the local Adaes Indians, a Caddoan group, Los Adaes was built in reaction to the French presence at Natchitoches, less than 20 miles to the east. The remoteness of Los Adaes, the lack of a French missionary effort, the willingness of the French to intermarry with both the Caddoan peoples and the Spanish, and the political/economic savvy of the Caddoan peoples were all factors that contributed to a Spanish, French, and Caddoan interaction characterized by cooperation, accommodation, and mutual support."
2004,A Clash of Two Cultures: Presidio La Bahía on the Texas Coast as a Deterrent to French Incursion,"Presidio La Bahía was built in 1722 over the remains of a 1685 French fort constructed by Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. The presidio served as a deterrent against future French aggression along the Texas Gulf Coast. Archaeological investigations conducted at the site from 1999 to 2002 recovered substantial information about the presidio and its relationship to the French fort. This work demonstrated that the Spanish erected an elaborate 16-point star-shaped fortification over the remains of the French fort, thus highlighting the importance Spain placed on defending the Texas Gulf Coast from future French threats."
2004,The Archaeology of Presidio San Sabá: A Preliminary Report,"Archaeological excavations at the 18th-century Spanish colonial site of Presidio San Sabá (41MN1) were conducted during the 2000 and 2001 Texas Tech Archaeological Field Schools under the supervision of Grant Hall and the author. Presidio San Sabá represents one of the most important Spanish frontier outposts in Texas. Written records concerning the presidio consist primarily of military correspondence and supply records with little or no attention paid to the families of soldiers stationed at the fort or their daily lives. Excavations have concentrated on recovering information from the plaza area, the rooms alongside the interior walls of the presidio, and the 1937 reconstructed portions of the fort. Preliminary analyses of the cultural materials recovered from these excavations are providing a glimpse into the everyday lives of those who resided there as well as a better understanding of the architecture and layout of the fort."
2004,The Presidio of San Antonio de Béxar: Historical and Archaeological Research,"Presidio San Antonio de Béxar was one of the four presidios established to halt French aggression into Northern New Spain from Louisiana between 1690 and 1722. Today, the presidio is in the heart of modern-day San Antonio, Texas. While the urban built environment setting today has impacted the remains of the presidio, one original structure still stands. In addition, compliance archaeological investigations in a restricted urban area have identified remains of three civilian residences in the former presidial town adjacent to the presidio as well as a portion of the original irrigation ditch, the acequia madre. Hampered by a shortage of colonial historical research to connect archaeological remains and occupants through deed transactions, there is still much useful information to be gleaned from the archaeological remains. One contribution from the archaeological studies is the refinement of several broadly defined ceramic types such as Puebla Blue-on-White and lead-glazed coarse earthenwares into chronologically distinct variants."
2004,San Diego Presidio: A Vanished Military Community of Upper California,"Popular views of San Diego Presidio portray it as a fortified community, inhabited largely by Spanish soldiers, who followed customs that were predominantly European. Ongoing documentary and archaeological research suggest that these views represent an inaccurate picture of the settlement and its people. For more than a third of its years of existence (1769-1835), the presidio was not protected by any fortifications. Throughout its history, the population of the base included large numbers of civilians. The people of the presidio represented a racially mixed community. The way of life that they pursued included elements that drew heavily on local Native American, and Mesoamerican, cultural roots."
2004,El Presidio de San Francisco: At the Edge of Empire,"El Presidio de San Francisco, the northernmost presidio of New Spain, was founded in 1776 as a reaction to the Russian economic expansion onto the Pacific coast of North America. Demographics indicate that the pool of colonial recruits bound for San Francisco came from regions with a diverse cultural matrix, including Native Californians, after the presidio was established. Over time, the colonial population became increasingly homogenous in recognizing its own ethnic identity. Although the location of the presidio of San Francisco was generally known prior to 1993, its exact location and the extent to which it was preserved archaeologically was unknown. The 1993 discovery confirmed its predicted general location but also revealed that its situation and configuration was somewhat different than that predicted by historic documents. Structural examinations of the site reveal considerable information about the settlement’s architectural development, which became increasingly institutionalized. Ongoing laboratory investigations of excavated deposits from the site indicate that dietary practices differed somewhat from other settlements in Alta California. The archaeological interpretation of this frontier presidio requires both global and local perspectives to reckon influences as diverse as European geopolitics and frontier pragmatics."
2004,"An East Indian Laborers’ Household in Nineteenth-Century Jamaica: A Case for Understanding Cultural Diversity through Space, Chronology, and Material Analysis","Cultural diversity is a hallmark of the Caribbean region. This diversity is the result of many diasporas, including European, African, East Asian, and East Indian. Historical archaeology has focused on cultural permutations of the demographically dominant European and African groups. The archaeological record of other groups is present and can add to our understanding of the true depth of diversity in the emergence of social landscapes. This paper explores chronological, spatial, and material evidence related to an East Indian laborers’ household excavated in St. Ann’s Bay, Jamaica. The ways in which space was structured and materials used were distinct from patterns observed in the households of African Jamaicans who resided in a separate locus at the same site. This data suggests potential of examining cultural identities through archaeology."
2004,"Rituals Captured in Context and Time: Charm Use in North Dallas Freedman’s Town (1869–1907), Dallas, Texas","Freedman’s Cemetery was the primary burial ground for virtually all of the African American community of Dallas, Texas, between 1869 and 1907. From 1991 through 1994, the Texas Department of Transportation sponsored archaeological investigations exhuming 1,150 in situ burials (containing a total of 1,157 individuals) from the path of highway construction. Fifteen burials were found with pierced coins, interpreted here as charms. The origins of coins modified as charms are first traced to the British Isles and the Middle Ages, and then an explanatory model for their adoption by enslaved (and later freed) African Americans is presented. Turning to the Freedman’s Cemetery burial data, a detailed appraisal of the demographics of charm utilization within a late-19th-century urban African American community is given. Comparisons of the cemetery charm sample are made to the demographic profile of charm use compiled from the Works Progress Administration ex-slave narratives. The manner of coin alteration (and thus charm creation) is also documented. Important differences between the historical documentary data and the archaeological evidence reveal the strengths and weaknesses inherent within each kind of data."
2004,Moved Buildings: A Hidden Factor in the Archaeology of the Built Environment,"While moving entire buildings was a common occurrence in the historic past, little detailed information about this activity exists in the documentary records before the 20th century. Archaeological evidence of moved buildings is also virtually nonexistent in the literature. This study describes methods that were used to move buildings in the 18th through the early-20th centuries and the features and artifact patterns that should result from this activity. Excavation of three Historical period sites of buildings moved in the 19th century in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area has revealed features and produced artifact frequencies corresponding to these expected patterns. This suggests that historical archaeological evidence of moved buildings is more common than we realize and must be considered in any architectural studies."
2004,A Seventeenth-Century Colonial Cottage Industry: New Evidence and a Dating Formula for Colono Tobacco Pipes in the Chesapeake,"This study examines locally manufactured tobacco pipes commonly found on 17th-century Chesapeake sites. Analysis of these artifacts has traditionally been dominated by questions regarding the ethnicity of their makers, often based on qualitative assessments of stylistic similarity between the pipes and the material culture of indigenous American or West African peoples. The authors maintain that quantitative approaches to studying tobacco pipes can serve to answer queries of who made, distributed, and smoked these items and where they were manufactured. Particularly, the authors explore whether Colono pipes were manufactured and distributed within the Virginia Colony. Stylistic evidence supports the idea that 17th-century Jamestown acted as a center of production and/or distribution for this tobacco pipe industry in the James River Valley. Additionally, bore diameter measurements reveal that certain standardized English tools were used to manufacture a majority of Colono pipes. The authors conclude that it is highly likely that these pipes were manufactured and distributed within a colonial market system. These insights also led to the creation and preliminary evaluation of a mean dating formula based on a temporal linear regression of the pipe data from excavations at Jamestown Island and its hinterland."
2004,"Writing for Many: Interdisciplinary Communication, Constructionism, and the Practices of Writing","Though each of us works in different geographical areas (Ghana, the Lower Mississippi Valley, and the Great Lakes), our research is unified by our use of multiple sources to explore the history of colonial encounters and commitment to demonstrate the value of archaeological sources in exploring the materiality of those encounters. Yet, each of us has struggled with writing about these encounters, particularly as we publish in a variety of venues serving multiple audiences of historians, anthropologists, archaeologists, and lay people. We examine the “split literatures” that develop from our efforts to write for a variety of audiences and assess how tensions between scientific discourse and narrative shape these literatures. The interdisciplinary collaboration that is celebrated as part of a rapprochement among history, anthropology, and archaeology requires new approaches to writing, which we explore here."
2004,"The New York African Burial Ground Project: Past Biases, Current Dilemmas, and Future Research Opportunities","The recent excavation of skeletal remains from the African Burial Ground in New York City and their current bioanthropological study and analysis at Howard University is contributing to our understanding of the conditions faced by Africans and their descendants in colonial North America. The complex nature of African enslavement points to the need for interdisciplinary and comparative research on African origins, as well as the biocultural interaction of members of the African Diaspora in the context of European enslavement practices. Research on variation in the biological health status of African-descent communities in the Americas is shown to contribute to knowledge of their social and cultural histories. Through public approval and support, our research team has been able to pursue a more sophisticated and extensive research plan than is usually allowed. The identities thus constructed are complex and compel novel questions. Additionally, our methodological approach empowers the descendant community to engage in its own cultural and historical construction."
2004,Resistance and Compliance: CRM and the Archaeology of the African Diaspora,"Archaeological investigations carried out in compliance with the dictates of the National Historic Preservation Act have played an integral role in developing our understanding of and approach to the archaeology of the African diaspora. These cultural resource management (CRM) studies include several landmark projects that helped shape the national approach to African American archaeology. However, as with other sectors of the discipline, CRM archaeology of the African diaspora is presently suffering from a period of stagnation and lack of focus. This paper considers CRM’s contribution to the archaeology of African America, past and present, and attempts to project the future place of CRM in the study of the African American past."
2004,Archaeology of the African Diaspora in Latin America,"Archaeology conducted at Latin American sites in Brazil, Cuba, Florida, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Peru has made significant contributions to our understanding of African Diaspora history. Historical archaeology of the African Diaspora in Latin America has explored technological innovations in pottery making, resistance to slavery, and everyday life. The unifying theme in these studies, like that of the Anglo colonies, has been ethnic or cultural markers of identity. Maroon studies have predominated, while plantation archaeology in Latin America is developing slowly. By placing Latin American sites within the context of theories such as ethnogenesis, focusing on intercultural interactions in Maroon and slave societies, and rediscovering the forgotten connections between Amerindians and Africans, it is possible to advance our understanding of African Diaspora social formation and culture creation."
2004,Making History in Banda: Reflections on the Construction of Africa’s Past,"Postmodern and post-structural stances have forced recognition of the ways in which the past is created in the present. Yet extreme forms of constructionism divert attention from the problem of how the past created the present and deny the autonomy of sociohistorical process. In this paper, I examine the tensions between what Michel-Rolph Trouillot (1995) terms “historicity 1” (the materiality of sociohistorical process) and “historicity 2” (historical narrative), arguing that it is important for archaeologists to retain a focus on how everyday practices of the past shaped the present. Yet the lived past cannot be considered in isolation from how we construct that past in the present. I examine these issues through a case study of Banda, Ghana, that draws on oral historical, archival, and archaeological sources to understand how daily life was affected by Banda’s changing relationship to global trade and hegemonic polities, at the same time maintaining an eye toward how that past operates today in an area torn by a long-standing chieftaincy dispute (Stahl 2001b). In a concluding section, I reflect on implications for African American archaeology."
2004,The Beginning and Future of African American Archaeology in Mississippi,"Nearly a decade ago, Theresa Singleton challenged archaeologists to begin investigations of black life in Mississippi, but only recently has a systematic program begun. In 1995, a program in the archaeology of African American sites in Mississippi was implemented at the University of Southern Mississippi. While still in the early phases of work, a number of sites have been located and tested in various regions in Mississippi. These sites range from antebellum cotton plantations to black communities of the early-20th century. The success of the initial stages of this program is due in large part to the development of partnerships with various agencies including African American preservation groups in Mississippi. The importance of working with descendant groups and conducting oral histories and ethnographic studies has been stressed in this program in order to make the most accurate interpretations possible about African American life from slavery to contemporary times in Mississippi and to ensure African Americans are involved in these interpretations."
2004,"Ethnographic Analogy, Archaeology, and the African Diaspora: Perspectives from a Tenant Community","From its inception, archaeologists have been forced to rely on ethnographic analogies when attempting to make behavioral interpretations for past humans. In the study of the institution of slavery, archaeologists have drawn a vast majority of these analogies from modern cultures of West Africa—those cultures thought to have provided the largest number of enslaved peoples to North America. This paper will attempt to demonstrate that the Gullah and Geechee cultures of the Carolina Low-country may very well represent a far more important source for such analogies. These cultures have been overlooked as a result of the view among social scientists and historians that the Gullah/Geechee represent the “end result” of a unique set of evolutionary factors not found elsewhere within the South. Primary among these factors is their isolation from European Americans and other African Americans. However, the historic roots of the Gullah/Geechee are embedded within enslavement, Reconstruction, tenancy, sharecropping, and land holding—many of the same forces that helped to shape African American cultures throughout North America, unlike the cultures of West Africa. An example derived from the historical archaeological research conducted at the Levi Jordan Plantation, Brazoria County, Texas, will be employed to demonstrate the importance of the Gullah and Geechee analogies in understanding the lives of enslaved and freed African Americans."
2004,"Race, the National Register, and Cultural Resource Management: Creating an Historic Context for Postbellum Sites","The Texas Historical Commission, Council of Texas Archeologists, and representatives from local cultural resource management (CRM) firms recently discussed the role of late-19th and early-20th century sites, including their educational value and fairness in representation of diverse social groups. I consider the dialogue regarding these sites as part of a national problem regarding the interpretation of National Register eligibility, especially in the realm of CRM work. The current interpretations are dependent upon site significance and integrity, often failing to consider a site’s historical context by utilizing single-level analytical methods and disregarding regional interpretations. This results in a considerable bias in the sites that are nominated to the NRHP, as the central issues of race and historical representation and variations in site type are ignored in favor of one-sided evaluation methods and a lack of regional interpretations. To address this bias, improved communication and education within and between CRM firms, government agencies, and academic institutions are needed to re-emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary research at historic sites."
2004,Critical Race Theory and the Archaeology of the African Diaspora,"The critical race theory movement, an outgrowth of critical legal studies, offers historical archaeologists a paradigm for a more sophisticated, politically engaged treatment of the issue of race. Unfortunately, an uncritical social constructionist analysis can result in the trivialization or appropriation of the concerns of minority scholars, activists, and communities, a position critical race theorists characterize as “vulgar anti-essentialism.” Several examples of this process within historical archaeology are discussed. Historical archaeologists, particularly those studying the African Diaspora, need to develop community-based alliances that address common goals and enhance the relevance of their work. One potential mutually beneficial alliance would be with activists and scholars in the environmental justice movement."
2004,Considering the Future of African American Archaeology,"Contributors to this volume have outlined a number of issues that will continue to influence African American archaeology in the decade. This essay serves to highlight and synthesize these disparate themes into a single discussion. In particular, issues related to the spatial foci of African American archaeology; presentations of the African American past that continue to reflect constructs of racial inequality; and the role of community partnering are emphasized. The essay is closed with a consideration of how issues grappled with in African American archaeology will be of increased importance to the broader historical archaeological community."
2003,Colonial Origins and Colonial Transformations in Spanish America,"Archaeological data have been critical in articulating the manner by which system-wide structuring elements of Europe’s colonial projects in America were adjusted or transformed in local settings. This paper explores the ways in which certain of these structuring elements in Spanish colonial America were played out in a variety of households and communities, with the ultimate goal of approaching an archaeologically informed, comparative study of American colonialism. Several parameters are offered as examples of potentially fruitful points of comparison among colonial systems through which researchers might assess local agency at both intra- and inter-colonial scales. These include varieties of economic and governmental centrality, forms of labor organization, varieties of religious experience, gender relations, idealized social identities, and frontier-urban dichotomies."
2003,Russian Colonization: The Implications of Mercantile Colonial Practices in the North Pacific,"The maritime fur trade propelled Russian expansion into the North Pacific in the 18th and 19th centuries. The mercantile legacy of Russian colonization is evident in the rapid founding of settlements across an immense region, the corporate hierarchy of the colonial administration, and the policies and practices for the treatment of indigenous peoples. Russian fur merchants transported to North America colonial practices that originated in Siberia. In contrast to American and British merchants on the Northwest Coast who relied on commodity exchange with autonomous native hunters for furs, Russians forced native hunters to work directly for their companies, initially by military force and the taking of hostages to insure tribute payments and later by mandatory conscription. While relatively few Europeans immigrated to Russian America, colonial administrators relocated scores of native and “mixed blood” workers to new colonies. What emerged was a different twist to the colonial encounters that unfolded among indigenous populations and “colonists.” Rather than confronting successive waves of European immigrants, local peoples interacted primarily with other natives from homelands dispersed across the North Pacific. Historical archaeology has much to contribute to understanding the long-term impacts of “native-to-native” interactions in pluralistic colonial communities."
2003,An Encounter in the Baroque Age: French and Amerindians in North America,"European colonization of North America had its origins in the expansion of European capitalism. But, on the ground, what occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries was the encountering of certain European nations by certain native peoples. Our present field of interest is the particular nature of the encounter between Amerindians and the French, expressed in cultural métissage (mixture or hybridity) and political alliances, since this interaction contains all the ingredients that would lend distinctive colors to the new colonial societies. Exploration of European-Amerindian contacts on the part of archaeologists has already resulted in numerous studies focused on the economy, particularly with respect to the fur trade, or on the newcomers’ adaptations to a different environment. For the past few years, however, the author has attempted to approach the issue from another angle, that of representations. It is hoped that this approach will lead to a better understanding of the encounter and shed light on the elusive perceptions of that encounter deep in the minds of the actors involved. The thesis presented here is that a true compatibility existed between representations of the world by the French and by the Amerindians, that this compatibility explains the special nature of the relation between the two groups, and, finally, that the archaeological remains left behind by the two groups lend support to the argument for compatibility, enabling the author to make an original contribution to the comprehension of this encounter. The problem of colonial origins in New France may be approached within a dynamic framework whose main stages are linked one to another in time and space, from Europe to North America: the departure, the passage, the encounter, the contact, the exchange, and the métissage."
2003,"Spanish Botijas or Olive Jars from the Santo Domingo Monastery, La Antigua Guatemala","The Santo Domingo monastery in La Antigua Guatemala was occupied from 1543 until 1773. Recent construction and site excavation uncovered more than 350,000 imported and local ceramic sherds, among which were 585 botija or olive jar mouth rims, including 13 complete vessels. Rim marks found on 113 of the mouth rims include impressed, embossed, incised, and engraved designs. Impressed marks predominate, with 39 different marks found on 91 rims. Some previously reported marks, identical to those from Santo Domingo, help in postulating product distribution routes and in dating previously unreported marks. Rim marks and marking methods evolved concurrently with changing rim forms. As rim forms became more rounded, the incidence of incising, smaller rim marks, and horizontal application of stamped marks became more prevalent. Four rare impressed shoulder marks were found on John Goggin’s Late style vessel forms. These date prior to the monastery’s 1773 abandonment and thus suggest a revision of Goggin’s 1780 transition date from Middle to Late style botijas."
2003,Map and Database Construction for an Historic Cemetery: Methods and Applications,"Accurate maps and databases can be beneficial for research and management of cemeteries, but such documents have rarely been linked for historic cemeteries. This paper focuses on the mapping and inventorying of historic St. Michael’s Cemetery in Pensacola, Florida, and on potential applications of the results to other cemeteries. The mapping involved a global positioning system receiver to establish reference points and a total station survey of individual marked graves, borders, and fences. Grave inscriptions and marker attributes were recorded on a microcassette recorder and transcribed into a spreadsheet. All data were imported into a geographic information system to produce an accurate digital map and database. The map and database are suited to examine architectural trends and influences, historical social issues, evolving funerary customs, demographic trends, and cemetery management matters. The fully interactive map and database are available on the Web and can potentially serve archaeologists, historians, geographers, genealogists, geologists, forensic scientists, and anthropologists."
2003,Class and Gender in Nineteenth-Century Rural Michigan: The Merriman-Sharp Hillside Farm,"The social and material expression of class and gender is an active process; the meanings and symbols in social contexts are constantly being negotiated and renegotiated. These meanings can be approached through a wide variety of sources, including material culture, landscape, architecture, and documents. In 1912 Ella Wing (Merriman) Sharp willed much of the farm and home she had inherited from her mother, Mary Merriman, and her personal property to the City of Jackson, Michigan, with specific provisions that her farm be turned into a park and her home into a museum. During their residence and even after their deaths, these two women manipulated the environment, both material and natural, in and around their farm and house to communicate very specific messages about their class and gender status."
2003,The Geochemistry of Worcester Porcelain from Dr. Wall to Royal Worcester: 150 Years of Innovation,"The compositions of 54 sherds (ca. 1751 to the early 1900s) from three Worcester porcelain factory sites were determined by electron microprobe. The data show that the early proprietors of the first (Warmstry House) factory initially (1751) produced a mildly phosphatic frit (lead-bearing) ware. Soapstone was added to this paste (and flint glass frit virtually eliminated) after Worcester acquired the Lund’s Bristol works early in 1752. It is not known when in the early or mid-1750s they abandoned this transitional paste in favor of their long used soapstone-frit paste. One transitional phosphatic sherd has an unusually high magnesium content (16.5 wt.% MgO), indicating the use of ∼48 wt.% soapstone, probably added to improve the paste’s plasticity. A nonphosphatic, experimental ware is unusually lead-rich (17.1 wt.% PbO), apparently reflecting an attempt to achieve a more vitrified ware than the earlier phosphatic porcelain. After about the mid-1750s, relatively minor variations were made to the Mg-Pb paste, but some wares produced during the Flight and Barr period (1792–1804) have compositions intermediate between true (Si+Al-rich) porcelain and lead-free soapstone wares. True porcelain sherds were recovered from Robert Chamberlain’s Diglis factory (1783–1840), which later became Chamberlain & Co. and, subsequently, was operated by Kerr and Binns who produced bone china. At the St. Martins Gate works, the Graingers manufactured true porcelain and bone china. Both Grainger wares used a novel, variably lead-bearing, barium-rich glaze. In 1862, the above-mentioned factories amalgamated under the auspices of Royal Worcester, which, like Grainger, produced true porcelain and bone china but, instead, used barium-free, alkali-lime, and lead-bearing glazes on these two types of ware, respectively. The geochemical data indicate that the history of porcelain manufacture in Worcester is one of both continuity and innovation."
2003,Perspectives on the Early-Nineteenth-Century Frontier Occupations of the Missouri Ozarks,"American settlers began moving into the Missouri Ozarks in the early-19th century. Despite extensive historical research, however, very few early-19th-century farmsteads have been investigated archaeologically in the region. Using the data generated by limited excavations at seven sites, combined with a study of store records from the1840s and travelers’ accounts, this paper provides an archaeological perspective of life on the Missouri Ozarks frontier. In particular, as in other frontier settings, status differences do not appear to be visible in the archaeological record. In this case, the explanation may be related to the Scotch-Irish cultural traditions of the inhabitants."
2003,"Archaeology, Memory, and Landscapes of Conflict","The authors in this volume show how various communities can use archaeology to remember a particular historical event and how groups use symbols and landscapes to reinforce particular meanings. Examples are provided of landscapes that were historically contested, such as places where battles were fought, where strikes occurred, or where racism existed. They were landscapes of conflict in the past, and they survive today as places where memories of a particular event vary between groups. The examples in this volume demonstrate that meanings associated with landscapes of conflict are not necessarily static. Understanding how and why some groups tend to remember a particular past, while others forget or ignore a past, is an important issue for critically evaluating and knowing how people understand landscapes."
2003,"GPS, GIS and the Civil War Battlefield Landscape: A South Carolina Low Country Example","The results of Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of Civil War earthworks in Beaufort and Jasper counties, South Carolina, are presented. Most earthworks were part of a defensive system built by Confederate forces over the course of the war to protect the Charleston to Savannah railroad, which itself was part of a vital supply line allowing rapid transport of men and materiel throughout the Confederacy. For most of the war, Union forces were deployed at Port Royal Sound less than 40 km from the railroad. The Confederates met this threat through fixed defenses at strategic locations combined with rapid movement of troops by rail. This strategy and these tactics are understandable within the geographic context provided by GPS/GIS technology and a military context provided by a detailed campaign history."
2003,"Confederate Fortification and Troop Deployment in a Mountain Landscape: Fort Edward Johnson and Camp Shenandoah, April 1862","By April 1862 Union forces had established control of the headwater streams of the Potomac drainage in what was to become West Virginia and were beginning to move south into the Shenandoah Valley of western Virginia. Threatened by the possible flanking of his Confederate Army at the mountain stronghold of Camp Allegheny, which blocked Union access into the central Shenandoah Valley, General Robert E. Lee ordered the camp commander, General Edward Johnson, to identify and then move to a more defensible position to the east. On 5 April, Johnson’s 4,000-man army began the process of converting the apex of Shenandoah Mountain, 40 mi. to the east of Camp Allegheny, into a complex fortification designed to again prevent Union access into the valley and the important military depot at Staunton, Virginia. For 14 days, the troops worked to fortify the mountain and prepare the encampments needed for their support. Then, in the absence of Johnson and in an environment of rumor and believed Union threat, the military complex was ordered abandoned. In 1998 and 1999 researchers from James Madison University, with support from George Washington and Jefferson National Forests, surveyed, tested, and mapped the earthwork and encampment features of the Fort Edward Johnson-Camp Shenandoah Military Complex. While never actually used in the engagement of the enemy, the archaeological remains provide an invaluable, glimpse into the manner in which the Confederacy adapted fortification and encampment strategies to a mountain landscape."
2003,European Military Sites As Ideological Landscapes,"The American tradition of devoting substantial quantities of public resources to the acquisition and preservation of battle sites is generally foreign to European nations. Many battlefields in Europe are unmarked or have few monuments. Preservation efforts at most of the remaining sites have concentrated upon relatively small portions such as isolated structures or natural vistas. Cemeteries are at times integral elements of these landscapes. Selected battlefields in Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Czech Republic provide varied examples of European landscape preservation and commemoration. It is argued that the often minimal preservation efforts in Europe reflect an ideological landscape of modern political and social concerns."
2003,Oral Tradition and Archaeology: Conflict and Concordance Examples from Two Indian War Sites,"The Sand Creek Massacre of 1864 and the 1877 Nez Perce War, Battle of the Big Hole, abound in oral tradition and historical sources. Archaeological investigations at both sites have yielded substantial numbers of battle-related artifacts. The physical evidence supports and modifies the historical record in both cases. The Big Hole battle’s oral traditions were substantiated by the archaeological work as well. However, the Sand Creek Massacre’s oral tradition of the site location is in direct conflict with reanalysis of the historic documents and the archaeological findings. The two cases are contrasted to vividly point out how groups accept or reject evidence gathered using the scientific method when it either agrees or disagrees with their preconceived notions of cultural truth."
2003,"The Ludlow Massacre: Class, Warfare, and Historical Memory in Southern Colorado","Because battlefields can be potent symbols in the construction of historical memory, they can remain sites of struggle for as long as that memory is important. History professionals, such as archaeologists, participate fully in these struggles. The commemoration of the Ludlow Massacre Site, a battlefield in the industrial wars of the early-20th century is discussed. The commemoration of Ludlow highlights the role of class interest in the construction of historical memory. Doing archaeology at Ludlow entails acknowledging these interests, both ours, as archaeologists, and those of the working class people who guard the memory of Ludlow."
2003,"Conflict and the Interpretation of Palmares, a Brazilian Runaway Polity","In recent years, historical archaeologists have become increasingly interested in exploring how to use material culture to study conflict and how the interpretation of their sites is affected by modern perception. Grounded in a dialectical epistemology, the experience of past peoples is considered part of an ongoing social confrontation between social actors. Archaeologists tend to consider cultures as neatly bounded homogeneous entities. The holistic, monolithic nature of cultures has been put into question by several empirical and theoretical studies. In northeastern Brazil, a large maroon kingdom called Palmares developed in the 17th century, and people have often interpreted it in two ways. Some prefer to stress the African character of the polity, while others emphasize the diversity within the community. Archaeological research at Palmares produced evidence of a heterogeneous society, an interpretive model that does not follow dominant epistemological schemes and prejudices."
2003,The Hector Backbone: A Quiescent Landscape of Conflict,"The Hector Backbone, a ridge running north-south between New York’s Seneca and Cayuga Lakes, appears at first glance to be a peaceful stretch of woodland and pasture protected as part of the Finger Lakes National Forest. Upon closer inspection, the Backbone can be seen as a microcosm of American conflict. The area was settled only after the indigenous Iroquoian people were violently removed. This ethnic cleansing was followed by the imposition of an orderly grid. The landscape was carved into farmsteads that, following a brief period of prosperity, fell victim to conflict inherent in the capitalist system. Unable to compete with factory farming techniques and the increased commodification of agrarian products, local producers fell into ruin. This paper analyzes how these conflicts can be read in this seemingly pastoral landscape."
2003,Integrating Segregated Urban Landscapes of the Late-Nineteenth and Early-Twentieth Centuries,"The period of legal segregation in the United States is characterized in modern thought as a system of racial separation prevalent in the South around the first half of the 20th century. Separation implies a spatiality that seems to lend itself to a landscape study. In problematizing such a study, it becomes clear that the spatial signs of segregation are markers in a complex system of identity building and maintenance relationships. The association of identity politics with cultural landscape analysis provides a picture of segregation that pushes beyond the bounds of African American neighborhood or residential sites. Examining three turn-of-the-20th-century sites in Annapolis, Maryland, provides an example of how archaeology, in examining urban contexts, has a role in how this period of segregation is perceived."
2003,Reinterpreting Manassas: The Nineteenth-Century African American Community at Manassas National Battlefield Park,"The American Civil War is a watershed in United States history. One of the most important events that came from this conflict was the end of legalized enslavement of African Americans. Manassas National Battlefield Park is an excellent venue to present this history as it contains sites ranging from the period of enslavement through the Jim Crow era. These sites record the struggle of African Americans and place the battle-related events of the Civil War in historical context. The transformations that occurred within the African American community at Manassas are discussed in this paper. In addition to the battle events that transpired during the war’s five-year history, these transformations, a type of alternative history, should be presented at Manassas National Battlefield Park as well as at other Civil War battlefields across the South."
2003,Heyward Shepherd: The Faithful Slave Memorial,"During the 1920s and 1930s the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) and the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) received considerable publicity with their cosponsorship of a “faithful slave” monument in Harpers Ferry. Sitting in Lower Town Harpers Ferry in the midst of an urban landscape, the Heyward Shepherd Monument has different meanings to Southern heritage groups, the National Park Service, and the NAACP. Its tumultuous history shows the dynamic nature of commemorative landscapes, and it demonstrates how different interest groups interpret this landscape feature. The Heyward Shepherd Monument still stands in the national park and the National Park Service sees itself as the custodian of this cultural resource. While the UDC and the SCV see the monument as an important symbol of Southern heritage, the NAACP has lobbied to have it removed from the landscape."
2003,"Clay Faces in an Abolitionist Church: The Wesleyan Methodist Church in Syracuse, New York","For many years, a group of sculpted clay faces, in desperate and immediate need of conservation, tenuously clung to the walls of the dug-out space called a “tunnel” beneath the former Wesleyan Methodist Church, the home of a noted abolitionist and social-reform oriented congregation in downtown Syracuse, New York. Archaeological and historical research indicates a 19th-century origin for the faces. The church openly participated in abolition and the Underground Railroad, and housed a national abolitionist press. However, even in a pro-emancipation community such as Syracuse, the dangers for refugees fleeing bondage were real, and the consequences of capture were life threatening. This was particularly true after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act in 1850. This study presents evidence that the clay faces may have been created by African American refugees from slavery. Moreover, it describes a community’s efforts to conserve and protect this resource."
2003,"Dating Historical Sites: The Importance of Understanding Time Lag in the Acquisition, Curation, Use, and Disposal of Artifacts","Each object has a lifespan in which it is made, transported, marketed, used, and discarded. Although the manufacturing date range for artifacts may be known, we should not equate the manufacturing range for an object type with the use range for a particular object. Studies from several locations indicate ceramic artifacts have lifespans of as much as 15 years and more in a household before being discarded. Ceramics can be poor sources for dating sites if used without considering the cultural contexts in which they are used, yet ceramics are the artifact class used most often in dating sites."
2003,"The Ties That Bind: Economic and Social Interactions in Early-Colonial New Mexico, A.D. 1598–1680","Regional economic transactions in early-colonial New Mexico (1598–1680) have frequently been overlooked as archaeologists and historians focused on large scale, long-distance trade in the imperial economy or smaller scale household production. The few discussions of the regional economy, transactions within the colony, have generally described it as “primitive” and “crude.” There was, however, an active regional economy during this period that resulted in movement of goods between colonists’ and native peoples’ households. The nature of these interactions depended largely on the social identity of the household. In addition, the movement of goods bound households socially as well as economically. Analyzing economic interactions on the regional scale provides a better understanding the colonization process in general because economic restructuring is one way in which empires integrate newly conquered territories. In early-colonial New Mexico, more specifically, economic interactions formed one bridge between the individual household economies and the imperial economy."
2003,To Feed a Tree in Zion: Osteological Analysis of the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre,"In September 1857, some 120 men, women, and children on a wagon train bound for California were massacred in southwestern Utah. Who was responsible for the Mountain Meadows Massacre is a question that still sparks considerable debate. According to traditional historical accounts, the adult males of the company were shot by local Mormon militiamen, while the women and children were killed by Paiutes or other Native Americans. An unexpected opportunity to assess the skeletal evidence in the case arose in summer 1999, when a mass grave containing 28 of the victims was accidentally unearthed. Bullet wounds were found to affect primarily young men, although one subadult and possibly a female also exhibited gunshot trauma. The crania of three children, two subadult males, and one adult female were fractured by blunt force trauma. No wounds were identified that would corroborate historical accounts of the victims being scalped, having their throats cut, or being shot by arrows."
2003,"“In-Sites,” Historical Archaeology in Australasia: Some Comparisons with the American Colonial Experience","The first contacts between the United States and Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) were made by the wide-ranging American sealers in the 1790s, followed by the whalers in the first decades of the 19th century. This occurred only a few years after the first permanent European settlement in Australia was established in Sydney Cove in 1788 but some 50 years before New Zealand was formally annexed by Britain in 1840. Since then, both nations have gradually developed their own identities, but, up until World War II, they maintained strong ties with Britain, despite the growing industrial might of the United States and its increasing presence in the Pacific region. This paper, based on part of an invited keynote address presented to the plenary session at the Society for Historical Archaeology’s 1999 conference at Salt Lake City, Utah, examines the colonial experiences of the three nations. Through comparison of some key artifact types, this paper highlights both differences and links among the societies that have developed in the British colonies Australasia and the older, more divergent Anglo-American culture."
2003,Exporting Culture: Archaeology and the Nineteenth-Century British Empire,"Comparison of Australia with other postcolonial nations provides a means for analyzing the material culture of 19th-century British colonization. Developments in Australia paralleled those in Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand. As a result of changes in politics, industry, knowledge, culture, and society, migrants at this time differed significantly from those of earlier periods of British colonization. Comparison between colonial outposts provides a means for better understanding this emerging culture of British imperialism. Rather than reflecting the adoption of archaic physical forms, this pattern drew on the many complex strands of class, industrialization, urbanization, and mass consumption that informed contemporary British society. A globally aware perspective on British culture raises new questions for archaeologists in the United States, Britain, and the countries of the former British Empire."
2003,Revisiting the Worldview: The Archaeology of Convict Households in Sydney’s Rocks Neighborhood,"The excavation of the Cumberland/Gloucester Streets Site in Sydney’s historic Rocks area in 1994 was marked by the successful application of an innovative, integrated approach to urban archaeology in Australia. This approach allowed fresh explorations of many aspects of Sydney’s social and cultural development, including the material world of the first generation of convict settlers. This paper examines that world within the wider context of standard and more recent interpretations of the convict colony, as well as drawing on and evaluating scholarship in the history of material life over the last 20-odd years. It offers some reflections on the idea of the worldview, the importance of local context, and the ways in which we approach the archaeology of settler societies."
2003,“The Absence of Ghosts”: Landscape and Identity in the Archaeology of Australia’s Settler Culture,"This article is a case study investigating archaeology as a practice embedded in a complex web of culturally constructed codes of meaning or discourses. A distinctive form of discourse concerning the landscape and its role in determining national identity characterizes Australian culture. This discourse has been central to the construction of the idea of the nation and its past: in particular, concepts of the land as hostile and empty, of the bush as the essence of Australia, and of the landscape as feminine. The paper considers the ways in which this landscape discourse has operated within historical archaeological research and heritage management and discusses the implications of these discursive relationships for past and future research."
2003,The Ethos of Return: Erasure and Reinstatement of Aboriginal Visibility in the Australian Historical Landscape,"Aboriginal efforts to secure the repatriation and reburial of their ancestors’ remains represent an undoing of the colonial project of collection. It is but one element of an ethos of “return” that challenges white-settler society’s turning of a blind eye to the continued presence of Aboriginal people in the post-1788 landscape. Archaeologists in Australia, along with heritage professionals generally, have for the most part not deployed their skills and knowledge in the interests of revealing the historical coexistence and entanglement of settler and Aboriginal cultures. Rather, archaeologists have practiced a form of segregation that finds no room for Aboriginal people and their story in the historical landscape as archaeology constructs it. The case is put for archaeologists themselves to embrace an ethos of return that reverses this erasure."
2003,"(Re) Constructing a Lost Community: “Little Lon,” Melbourne, Australia","The reanalysis of archaeological and documentary evidence of a vanished community (that of Casselden Place in the heart of the area known as “Little Lon” in central Melbourne) has fostered a more thoroughgoing exploration of the nature of the urban slum in Australia. There are significant questions raised by the interpretation of Casselden Place (and Little Lon) as a community during the 19th century (some of the most important of which center on the nature of assemblage composition among poor households of the period). This paper also touches on the means by which new and more complex histories of such vanished communities can be written. As such, the discussion builds on earlier methodological statements and more detailed discussions of the life histories of individuals who lived in Casselden Place (Mayne and Lawrence 1998; Mayne and Murray 1999; Mayne et al. 2000; Murray and Mayne 2002) to provide a more specific discussion of the archaeological elements of the project. The analysis of the assemblage reported here is very much a work in progress. Analysis of assemblages drawn from Casselden Place and those from the rest of Little Lon continues, reaching beyond the level of establishing artifact frequencies and exploring the meaning of the counter-intuitive patterns that are discussed in the paper."
2003,Annales-Informed Approaches to the Archaeology of Colonial Australia,"Archaeologists have generally been slow to recognize the value of Annales approaches to their discipline, and maritime archaeologists, in particular, have been even slower. The analytical framework used in this paper draws on applications of Annales approaches to archaeology in what is termed the “archaeology of the event.” The resulting holistic approach places the specificity of the event within the wider cultural context. Furthermore, terrestrial historical archaeology has largely ignored the potential that cargo material, derived from maritime archaeological excavations, has to contribute to understandings of colonial settlement. This paper moves beyond the usual functional approaches to the analysis of the meanings of material culture. A major part of the archaeological data used here is drawn from the cargo assemblages of four post-settlement shipwrecks excavated in Australian waters during the past 30 years: Sydney Cove, James Matthews, William Salthouse, and Eglinton. This paper provides a theoretical and methodological model for the systematic analysis of consumer goods that can be used to better understand cultural aspects of colonial settlement."
2003,"Showdown in the Pacific: A Remote Response to European Power Struggles in the Pacific, Dawes Point Battery, Sydney, 1791–1925","Showdown in the Pacific: A Remote Response to European Power Struggles in the Pacific, Dawes Point Battery, Sydney, 1791–1925"
2003,The Archaeology of Crisis: Shipwreck Survivor Camps in Australasia,"Shipwreck survivor camps are a neglected terrestrial component of maritime archaeology, usually being investigated purely as an adjunct to work on the associated wreck site. Most studies have considered these sites as individual and unique, molded by the particulars of the historic events that created them. However, by considering the history, anthropology, and archaeology of a series of Australasian survivor incidents and sites, this paper highlights common elements and themes, which allow examination of these sites within a comparative framework. These include the development of authority structures, social organization, salvage and subsistence strategies, material culture, short- and long-term rescue strategies, and the possible influences of crisis-related stress upon the decisions made by individuals and groups. Survivor camp studies are linked into the wider concerns of maritime archaeology and anthropology by placing them within the context of wreck formation models."
2003,Problem Orientation in Australian Historical Archaeology,"Australian historical archaeologists still have to convince many academics in other disciplines and the public at large that archaeological research concerned with the material record of the last two centuries is a legitimate intellectual pursuit in its own right. In the academic arena, their subject has gained comparatively little attention from departments usually dominated by prehistoric archaeologists and social anthropologists. In the heritage management field, they can find themselves competing with historians, architects, and engineers. An examination of a selection of the published research literature in Australian historical archaeology from the last 30 years suggests that this lack of legitimacy exists because of the sorts of questions that are being asked. Often these have been historical rather than archaeological, but the results have seemed inconsequential to historians. Yet archaeology can offer something that history cannot: it can extract unique information from physical evidence, providing it asks archaeological questions rather than historical ones and uses appropriate processes of archaeological analysis."
2002,The development of historical archaeology in Israel: An overview and prospects,"The Ottoman Empire ruled over Palestine from 1516 to 1917; the nature of imperial control and the legacy of the Ottoman centuries are contested. A decade after several calls for archaeology in Israel to include the Ottoman period, in part to address some of the debates, several archaeological projects have yielded the parameters of an historical archaeology in Israel. The difficulties associated with the terminology of historical archaeology in the Middle East are briefly considered, and the definition of historical archaeology in the region as the archaeology of the Ottoman Empire is advocated. Four archaeological examples —Tel el-Hesi, Ti’innik, Yocne’am, and Akko—are employed to illustrate the contribution of this research to resolving historical questions and for contextualizing Palestine within regional and global processes of change. The prospects of the research trajectories conclude the review."
2002,Preservation of waterlogged wooden buttons and threads: A case study,"A hydroxyl-ended polymer blended with hydrolyzable, multifunctional alkoxysilanes was used to preserve composite artifacts consisting of waterlogged wooden buttons with threads still firmly attached. Excavated from the 17th-century wreck of La Salle’s vessel, La Belle, these artifacts posed a significant conservation challenge. Since previous attempts to remove the threads had caused damage to the underlying wood, the decision was made to conserve the buttons and threads simultaneously, using a silicone oil/cross-linker solution. The buttons were then exposed to vapor catalyzation to complete the polymerization process. After preservation, only minimal shrinkage of the wood and threads was noted."
2002,"The maintenance of cultural and personal identities of enslaved Africans and British soldiers at the Brimstone Hill Fortress, St. Kitts, West Indies","The Brimstone Hill Fortress, one of the largest colonial military complexes in the Caribbean, was occupied by the British from 1690 to 1854. Until the 1830s, a workforce of enslaved Africans constructed and maintained the fort. Among artifacts recovered from two buildings occupied by slaves are 155 European-made ceramic and glass sherds, mostly from flatware, plates, and soup plates. They are notched or scratched with a variety of lines and geometric patterns as well as with English letters and X’s. Our studies indicate that these marks were one mechanism that British soldiers and enslaved Africans used to maintain their personal and cultural identities."
2002,Cultural coherency and resistance in historic-period northwest-coast mortuary practices at Kimsquit,"This paper analyzes the mortuary practices of the Kimsquit people of the central coast of British Columbia as seen at a cemetery dating approximately A.D. 1850–1927. The cemetery gives the outward appearance of rapid change in burial mode, grave goods, and grave monuments, coincident with increasing acculturative pressures. When considered within the context of written records of the Kimsquit people’s attitude to Euro-Canadian culture, the use of manufactured goods evident at associated domestic sites, and the ideology behind mortuary practices, it can be argued that there was a continuance of attitudes towards death, wealth, and descent in the mortuary complex. The patterns observed here support the position that creative changes may occur under conditions of intense colonial pressure, and they are directed by underlying structures of long-term history, such that change can be a more effective strategy towards cultural survival than extreme conservatism."
2002,Machine cut nails and wire nails: American production and use for dating 19th-century and early-20th-century sites,"The commonly cited sources used by archaeologists for dating nails have been rendered outdated by later research. Machine cut and headed nails date from 1815 onwards, while wire nails date from 1819 onward. Historical archaeologists need to avoid the simplistic use of invention dates and patent dates and focus instead on the mass-production dates. There can be a significant amount of time between an invention and its first production, and even greater time until production figures are significantly high enough to affect the archaeological record. Usually wire nails are ascribed an 1850s beginning date, but that date is both too early and too late. While some wire nails were produced in 1819, no significant quantities were produced in the United States until the mid-1880s. Thus, we need to extend the manufacturing date back some 30 years with the caveat that the effective manufacturing date range begins in the 1880s. By examining production figures for wire nails, a model is generated for dating sites built of machine cut nails. This model is then examined using data from dozens of sites in the USA and Canada. Just as important, the model provides clues to recycling activity and access to different manufacturing sources."
2002,"The role of resistivity survey in historic site assessment and management: An example from Fort Riley, Kansas","An electrical resistivity survey of the Army City site exemplifies how geophysics can enhance the investigation and management of large historic sites. Army City was a civilian-owned commercial complex that provided goods and services to World War I era troops training at Fort Riley, Kansas. The use of resistivity at Army City enhanced the reliability of inferences about the nature and integrity of deposits, reduced the long-term costs of site management, and helped identify biases in historic maps. Geophysical techniques have the potential to play an important role in cultural resource management. Archaeologists in the United States need to develop a better understanding of the applicability and reliability of various geophysical techniques and to identify ground-truthing strategies that achieve the best balance of information return, cost, and impact to the site."
2002,"Boss of the road: Early-20th-century consumer selections of work clothing from alabama gates work camp, Owens Valley, California","The beginning of the 20th century saw the establishment of more work-clothing companies fueled by changes in laborers’ clothing options and the expiration of the patent on riveted garments. While consumer strategies for buying merchandise revolved around the typical purchaser, generally the female head of the household, particular situations (such as work camps in the western United States) were overwhelmingly comprised of individual men who not only built water or transportation systems but needed to negotiate their way through outfitting themselves for this work. What kind of shopping choices and brand names were available to this consumer while working in isolated areas? Product availability and cost provide a context for examining the buying strategies and fashion choices of work-camp workers. The 393 brand-name buttons from at least 110 work-clothing garments identified during data recovery at the 1912 Alabama Gates Construction Camp in southeastern California is used as the case study."
2002,"Myth, migration, and material culture: Archaeology and the ulster influence on appalachia","Studies of the material record of the southern mountains, in conjunction with documentary research and judicious use of oral history, have the potential to fundamentally alter the manner in which the regional cultures and identities of Appalachia have traditionally been studied and, in so doing, to decrease the marginalization of the region through addressing the complexity of its past. A National Park Service-sponsored archaeological project centering on three mountain hollows in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, focused upon identifying and analyzing the physical traces of 18th- through 20th-century settlement in a region long portrayed as the last refuge of hardy Scotch-Irish pioneers. Information from this study is used to test the model of Scotch-Irish cultural dominance in Appalachia, with a reevaluation of the nature of the 18th-century migration from the north of Ireland and a critical consideration of the linkages between ethnicity and material expression."
2002,The changing face of work in the West: Some introductory comments,"Between the 18th and 20th centuries, a variety of work communities sprang up as an outgrowth of the expanding global economy in what is now the western United States. These communities typically served as outposts of distant moneyed interests, providing living quarters for the workers who extracted raw materials or constructed the infrastructure needed to transport such materials to urban centers. Unlike communities with more permanent and diversified economic foundations, life in such temporary settlements had as its backdrop relations among workers, employers, and the resources they sought to exploit. Dialogs between workers and capitalists continued to evolve over time as the West became industrialized, class relations were transformed, and resources were depleted. The articles in this volume explore various facets of those transformations and their broader implications."
2002,"Russian exploitation of Aleuts and fur seals: The archaeology of eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century settlements in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska","Shortly after Russian fur hunters found the uninhabited Pribilof Islands of St. Paul and St. George in the late 1780s, they began forcing Aleut men from the Aleutian Islands and Alaska Peninsula to travel there seasonally to provide labor for the profitable commercial harvest of northern fur seals. Recent archaeological surveys of the earliest Aleut and Russian work camps that were established on the islands show them to be unusual in many respects when compared to contemporary sites in the Aleutian Islands region. These include the absence of precontact site components, their relatively narrow period of occupation, their occupancy by an exclusively or nearly exclusively male population, and their potential as multiethnic settlements to reveal differences between the lives of Russian overseers and Aleut laborers."
2002,Industrial and domestic landscapes of a California oil field,"By the turn of the 19th century, the United States was a heavily industrialized nation in the midst of the Victorian period. A series of intertwined values developed concerning the appropriate use of space both in and out of the work place and home. While the majority pursued these standards, individuals working in extractive industries were often on society’s periphery. Squaw Flat is an isolated oil field in Ventura County, California, occupied from ca. 1912–1954. In a remote location with limited choices, workers at Squaw Flat were able to use the landscape to express societal values concerning professional, domestic, public, and private space."
2002,Struggling with class relations at a Los Angeles aqueduct construction camp,"Western work camps offer unique opportunities to examine the evolution of class relations in American society during the late-19th and early-20th centuries. The short-term occupations that characterized many of those communities can be used to examine quality of life, working conditions, and relations among workers at particular places and moments in time. By comparing conditions in camps from different periods, meaningful insights can then be gained concerning changes in class relations over time. Class relations are examined at a camp occupied in 1912 and 1913 during the construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct. It is argued that the behavior of the camp’s workers and supervisory staff must be understood in the broader context of the history of class struggles and the negotiation of class identities. While national and global trends influenced local class dynamics, regional conditions ultimately determined the timing of particular transformations."
2002,"The Unromantic West: Labor, capital, and struggle","A gang of historians has gunned down the “romantic West.” They have dismissed the notion of the West as a frontier of opportunity for all comers. The American West has been redefined as an arena of struggle involving complex relations of class, gender, ethnicity, and race. Western work camps and company towns existed as extensions of a global economy centered on the eastern United States. From the mid-19th century through the first decades of the 20th century, capital and people flowed into the West from Europe, Asia, and Mexico. In this internal periphery of U.S. capitalism, workers experienced the same type of exploitation and engaged in the same struggles as their brethren in other parts of the United States. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the coalfields of Colorado. The work camps and company towns that archaeologists excavate were loci of struggle, and historians cannot claim to understand them without considering these conflicts."
2002,Work camp settlement patterns: Landscape-scale comparisons of two mining camps in Southeastern Arizona,"As the other articles in this special issue well illustrate, work camps can be examined in depth from a variety of perspectives, each of which can yield interesting insights. But even survey data about the distribution of settlements across the landscape will often indicate similarities and differences in the archaeologically observed patterns. In this example, it is the differences that inspire questions about how factors such as technology, environment, class, and social structure influenced settlement patterns at two early-20th-century mining camps in southeastern Arizona."
2002,"Health, sanitation, and diet in a twentieth-century dam construction camp: A view from Butt Valley, California","As the demand for electricity and steady water supplies exploded in the early-20th century, newly incorporated power and water companies throughout the West scrambled to meet this need. Monumental projects were undertaken to construct dams, powerhouses, and related features to supply the currents and water needed for cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. Competition for workers was fierce, environmental conditions were harsh, and the time between beginning and ending a project was tight. The evolution of dam construction camps between 1900 and 1930 reflects a steady improvement in camp sanitation, health services, and diet, partially in response to state legislation. Archaeological work at the Butt Valley Dam Construction Camp provides insights regarding the extent to which camp operators complied with state mandates or even exceeded such standards."
2002,“Nothing but tar paper shacks”,"Satellite settlements, which frequently bordered model company towns, were usually explained as havens for prostitutes, gamblers, bootleggers, and social misfits. A study of Steptoe City, Nevada, revealed more complex social and economic realities and suggested that the phenomenon was not unique to company towns. Such settlements could better be understood as special case manifestations of the shantytowns or “wrong side of the tracks” neighborhoods, which plagued most towns throughout America."
2002,Becoming American: The archaeology of an Italian Immigrant,"Excavations at the Queens Family Court and Families Court Agencies Facility site in Jamaica, Queens County, New York, uncovered three turn-of-the-20th-century features associated with Michael Pette, an Italian immigrant, and his family. Pette arrived in New York nearly penniless in 1885. After holding a number of unskilled jobs, he became a successful real estate developer, newspaper publisher, and community leader. Combined data from archaeological excavation, an autobiography, newspaper accounts, and interviews with descendants reveal how this Italian immigrant assimilated into the American middle class and the role of material culture in the process."
2002,Detecting economic variability in the Red River Settlement,"A method is presented for establishing the relative economic positions of archaeological assemblages. Scales of economic means are independently derived from the archival and archaeological records of the Red River Settlement between 1830 and 1870 and are then tested for consistency of ranking. The results indicate that relative economic position can be observed on the basis of ceramic artifact assemblages alone, the beef cut results are not sufficiently robust, but a broader approach to faunal assemblages provides meaningful results. Persons or groups that are normally overlooked in historical documents, and sites or assemblages for which no written records exist, can then be included in discussions of economic variability on the basis of their ceramic assemblages. Such discussion leads to the possibility of establishing links between economic and social variability."
2002,Recycling bottles as building materials in the Pacific Islands,"In a recent article, David Burley investigated the use of beer bottles as grave decorations in the Polynesian kingdom of Tonga. Burley concluded that these should not be viewed in a symbolic framework, but instead that the bottles were merely convenient building materials. The custom of marking a grave with bottles is much more widespread, for it is found on the islands of Yap and Palau in the western part of Micronesia, and in the Solomon Islands of Melanesia. In Micronesia, bottles are used to mark paths and planting beds as well as graves. This article explores, briefly, some of the issues involved in recycling bottles."
2002,Artifact of empire: The tale of a gun,"The historical archaeology of later colonialism in tropical Africa has had little attention. An example of its potential is provided by a 9-Pounder Naval gun preserved in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, nearly 600 mi. (900 km) from the nearest coast. Manufactured in 1870 in London, it is a rifled muzzle-loader made at a time when British gun-production briefly (and finally) reverted to muzzle-loading because of a lack of confidence in early breech mechanisms. When already obsolete, it seems to have been supplied by the Royal Navy for use on a colonial government vessel on Lake Victoria at the beginning of the 20th century and to have served with distinction during the First World War, 44 years after its manufacture. Apparently preserved as a memento in a Kampala public park, its colonial associations subsequently led to a less public role but it has nevertheless survived, having a relevance for both European and African history."
2002,Social differentiation and exchange among the Kumeyaay Indians during the historic period in California,"Long distance exchange between the Kumeyaay Indians and other southern California Indian groups after Spanish colonization is poorly documented and understood. The intensive study of thousands of shell beads from an historic cemetery in the San Diego region indicates that traditional socioeconomic interactions persevered among some California Indians despite missionization, epidemic diseases, and the seizure of California Indian lands. A mortuary analysis of the distribution of beads and other grave associations in the same cemetery further suggests that Kumeyaay sociopolitical organization was more complex than previously noted. It does not appear that this complexity developed as a result of Spanish colonization, but instead continued after at least 80 years of intensive contact. The Kumeyaay example illustrates that often important economic and sociopolitical traditions are maintained despite clear attempts to acculturate colonized societies."
2002,"Curiosities and conundrums: Deciphering social relations and the material world at the Ben Schroeder Saddletree Factory and Residence in Madison, Indiana","As a locus of hand-craft production during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Ben Schroeder Saddletree Factory and Residence began as a single structure and evolved into an eclectic arrangement of industrial and domestic buildings. At first glance, the site and its residents appear to be aberrations, “exceptions to the rule,” perhaps even cautionary tales in historical archaeology. Upon closer inspection, however, it does not appear that this site is remarkably different from other loci of specialty production from this era. The Schroeder family, along with the documentary and material records that are their legacy, are a lens through which to view social relations at specialty production firms and the use of the material world by factory owners, particularly during times of major economic crisis."
2002,China or Prosser button identification and dating,"China buttons or “small chinas,” glass-like ceramic buttons, are one of the most often misidentified artifacts in 19th and 20th century sites. These buttons, manufactured by the Prosser process, date after 1840. The common varieties are characterized by the top side being quite smooth, the under side with an “orange peel” surface, and a noticeable seam around the edge. Fancy examples include such varieties as calicoes, ginghams, igloos, bird cages, and pie crusts. Button collectors have not only known for many years that these are ceramic not glass, but have created an excellent classification system that should be utilized, in a modified form, by historical archaeologists. This is a prime example of how costly it can be when archaeologists ignore the collectors and their published body of knowledge. For the sake of clarity it is suggested that china buttons be referred to as Prosser buttons in the archaeological literature."

2002,French colonial archaeology at old mobile: An introduction,"Twelve years of excavation and analysis of the Old Mobile archaeological site (1MB94) are revealing the physical and social dimensions of the capital of French colonial Louisiana between 1702 and 1711. The specialized studies included in this thematic issue document the interplay of French colonists, enslaved and free Native Americans, and Hispanic trade contacts as a new colonial society developed on the northern Gulf Coast at the turn of the 18th century."
2002,Earthfast (Pieux en Terre) structures at old mobile,"Recent investigations at Old Mobile have included excavation of the first earthfast pieux en terre buildings discovered at this early French colonial site. These small one-room structures may have been barracks for soldiers garrisoned at Fort Louis. Previously excavated structures, interpreted as domestic dwellings, are multi-room buildings of poteaux sur sole (post-on-sill), a more substantial construction method. Differences in floor plan, size, construction method, and associated artifact assemblages reflect differences in structure function and occupation."
2002,Native American and French cultural dynamics on the gulf coast,"Archaeological investigations at Old Mobile and Port Dauphin, and at the later sites of Bienville Square, Fort Condé Village, Bottle Creek, and Dog River, document the evolution of a relatively reciprocal and stable relationship between colonists and native peoples spanning the entire French colonial period, from 1699 to 1763. The nature of French-Indian interaction on the Gulf Coast contrasts with other areas of eastern North America at that time, such as the Mississippi Valley and the Northeast, where relations often were more fragile and alliances went with the best offer."
2002,Continuity and change in apalachee pottery manufacture,"The artifact assemblage from French colonial Old Mobile includes pottery thought to have been made by Apalachee Indians who emigrated from the Apalachee Province of Spanish Florida following the destruction of their missions in 1704. The suspected Apalachee ceramics are characterized by complicated stamped designs and folded and pinched rims. Colono ware pitchers and brimmed vessels with foot ring bases also are thought to have been made by Apalachee emigres. Paste characterization and analyses of design, manufacturing technology, and vessel morphology of this pottery were compared with known local Mobile types and known Apalachee types from Mission San Luis de Talimali in Florida. The results document continuity and change in Apalachee pottery production and may help track the dispersal of the Apalachees and resolve the timing of the disappearance of Apalachee pottery traditions from the archaeological record."
2002,Eighteenth-century glass beads in the french colonial trade,"French colonial sites and French contact Native American sites in the Louisiana colony are considered in an attempt to further refine bead chronology. Research is almost to the point where bead introductions can be assigned to particular decades. Such tight dating is one of the ultimate goals of bead chronology. If this goal is reached, we can date undocumented contact period sites, or perhaps even individual features on sites of long occupation."
2002,Faience styles in French Colonial North America: A revised classification,"Previous archaeological systems for classifying French faience have not proven (nor were they designed to be) applicable to the entire range of faience found at North American sites. By combining elements of two widely-used systems designed for faience from Québec and Illinois sites, and drawing on published information from French archaeologists and art historians, a revised classification is proposed that accounts for most of the faience likely to be recovered from 17th- and 18th-century sites in North America."
2002,Compositional analysis of glazed earthenwares from eighteenth-century sites on the northern Gulf Coast,"Compositional classification of colonial-era ceramics using neutron activation analysis has heretofore focused primarily on majolicas from Spain and Mexico. In order to expand the chemical database to include 18th-century French ceramics, 186 sherds from Old Mobile and nearby sites on the north-central Gulf Coast have been analyzed, including faïence blanche, faïence brune, Mexican majolicas, and several types of coarse earthenwares. Quantitative analysis of 23 elements provides a basis for distinguishing French and Spanish-colonial earthenwares, as well as suggesting some preliminary chemical groupings of French faïence."
2002,Chinese porcelain at old mobile,"Chinese porcelain has been found in some quantity at the French colonial town site of Old Mobile. These sherds are of fine quality, and are comparable to pieces found in princely collections in Europe and in the Topkapi Saray Museum in Istanbul. Most are finely painted in underglaze blue, but a few retain traces of overglaze polychrome decoration. French colonies of this period typically did not import large amounts of porcelain. Old Mobile’s proximity to Spanish colonial settlements, however, provided access to Asian porcelain obtained via the Manila galleon trade."
2002,Pipestone argillite artifacts from old mobile and environs,"Four different mineralogical varieties of pipestone have been recognized among 51 analyzed artifacts recovered from the Old Mobile site (1MB94) and from a contemporary, adjacent Native American site (1MB 147). X-ray powder diffractometry permits 11 specimens to be recognized as mineralogically simple Kansas pipestone and 35 specimens as mineralogically complex catlinite pipestone. It is possible to designate the specific original provenances (i.e., geologic sources) of the two types of pipestone, neither of which can be distinguished on the basis of diagnostic visual attributes in hand specimen. The Old Mobile site also yielded four examples of a very soft, grayish-red, easily carvable material interpreted as an unusual variety of catlinite, largely composed of poorly-crystallized talc, a raw material that has not been recognized previously in catlinite pipestone. A single pipe fragment from Old Mobile is composed of pale grayish-green “pipestone,” a well-crystallized, iron-rich chlorite of undetermined origin. Ten specimens from the contemporaneous Upper Creek Indian site of Fusihatchee (1EE191) consist of essentially identical chlorite, except that one also contains a minor amount of moderately well-crystallized talc."
2002,Archaeobotany at old mobile,"Although still in its initial phases, archaeobotanical research at Old Mobile has much to contribute toward our understanding of cultural dynamics on the Gulf Coast frontier. Results so far obtained suggest that staple crops were both imported and locally produced and included species native to the Old World (such as fava beans) as well as the New World (e.g., maize and common beans). Archaeobotanical assemblages from different structures at Old Mobile reveal variability in conditions affecting preservation, but may also reflect socioeconomic status and ethnicity of the occupants. The hypothesis that Indian women sharing households with European men acted as agents of “dietary acculturation” deserves further consideration."
2002,Faunal remains from old mobile,"The high acidity of soils at the Old Mobile site has limited recovery of faunal remains to small calcined specimens. Despite poor preservation, however, samples of bone and shell fragments from each of the excavated structures indicate a reliance on wild fauna, with lesser dependence on domesticated species. Chicken and pig remains have been found, although other domesticates are mentioned in historical documents. Comparison with the faunal assemblage from the contemporary Indian house site (1MB147) suggests ethnic differences in food preferences during this initial period of French colonization."
2002,Status and trade at port dauphin,"Founded in 1702, Port Dauphin was the Gulf coastal port for the main French colonial settlement of Mobile, 80 km (50 mi.) to the north. Excavations on Dauphin Island at the stockade site (1711–1722) and, most recently, at a portion of Port Dauphin Village (primary occupation, ca. 1715–1725) have yielded archaeological data from the second and third decades of French occupation. Coins and European ceramics from these sites shed light on the relationship between status and trade among the inhabitants of the early French settlement on Dauphin Island."
2002,Discussion: Towards an archaeology of the French in America,"This collection of studies on the French colonial site of Old Mobile reflects the intensity with which early 18-century French colonists on the Gulf Coast engaged other Europeans (in Europe and in other North American colonies) and Native Americans (both free and enslaved) in social and economic interactions that eventually led to the creation of a new, regionally differentiated colonial culture. A synthesis of the archaeology of the French presence in North America will have to take into account the diversity of the French colonial experience, one facet of which is explored in this set of essays."
2001,Linking artifact assemblages to household cycles: An example from the Gibbs site,"In this essay, a new quantitative method called time sequence analysis is introduced. The method is used to link artifact distributions to family cycles, allowing reconstruction of consumption dynamics across several generations. Information for the study was recovered from excavations conducted at the Gibbs site, a 19th-century farm near Knoxville, Tennessee. Four generations of the Gibbs family occupied the site between 1792 and 1913. The relationship between household cycles and material consumption is measured statistically with correlation tests using time sequence analysis. The analysis results indicate that, given optimum excavation and documentary contexts, artifact assemblages can be linked directly to successive household cycles."
2001,French beads in France and Northeastern North America during the sixteenth century,"Although it is generally recognized that the French played an important role in the bead trade during the early contact period in Northeastern North America, there have been no serious attempts to carry out archival research and to locate reference collections of beads in France; consequently, surprisingly little is known about French beads. North American bead researchers are still asking some very basic questions about the provenience, chronology, and trade of French glass beads. This study seeks to answer these questions by drawing on a combination of written sources and archaeological collections—early French travel literature and collections of beads from First Nations contact sites. Information from these relatively well-known sources is supplemented with new data gathered from post-mortem inventories of Parisian bead-makers and from notarized contracts containing descriptions of beads purchased for the North American trade. The study also draws on a unique collection of beads dating from the second half of the 16th century, recently unearthed in the Jardins du Caroussel, near the Louvre Museum in Paris."
2001,Delaware archaeology and the revolutionary eighteenth century,"Many theorists see the 18th century as a time of profound change in European America. This paper tests some of these theories with data from 21 different 18th-century archaeological sites in Delaware that have been extensively excavated. The sites date to all parts of the 1680–1830 period, and their occupants span the social range from poor tenants to well-to-do planters. Eighteen of the excavations were sponsored by the Delaware Department of Transportation, and the techniques employed in the excavation and analysis of these sites were quite similar. Comparing the house remains, farm layouts, ceramics, glass, tablewares, clothing-related artifacts, and faunal remains from these sites reveals a complex pattern of developments. Certain parts of the material culture of rural Delaware did experience profound and relatively rapid change, especially ceramics and tablewares. Other aspects of life, however, including housing and meat consumption, changed very little, if at all. The archaeological record does not support the view that the 18th-century saw changes in outlook and thinking that influenced every part of American life."
2001,The archaeology of military politics: The case of castle clinton,"The West Battery, later renamed Castle Clinton, was constructed off the tip of Manhattan, New York, between 1808 and 1811. Following Paul J. F. Schumacher (1955) and John L. Cotter (1962), William D. Hershey conducted excavations inside the castle for the National Park Service (NPS) reconstruction efforts in 1963 (Hershey 1963). His excavations revealed several discrepancies between the fortifications that were planned and those that were built. These modifications to the original design were never satisfactorily explained. In the early 1960s, the archives of Col. Jonathan Williams, the architect of the West Battery, were discovered, transcribed, and compiled by NPS historian Thomas Pitkin (1963). This paper attempts to reconcile the design changes in the construction of Castle Clinton with the archives of its architect and builder Col. Williams. This reconciliation provides additional information concerning the construction of fortifications in New York Harbor, the flexibility accorded the early engineers, and the politics of the early 19th century military."
2001,From tanning to tea: The evolution of a neighborhood,"This study traces the transformation of an outlying industrial district in lower Manhattan into one of the city’s most densely populated working-class neighborhoods-Five Points. Using census research conducted for the Foley Square/Five Points project, the demographic as well as physical changes are discussed in the context of the district’s reputation as the city’s most notorious 19th-century slum. The evolving spatial organization of one of the excavated lots is used to provide a picture of living conditions and a backdrop for the interpretive studies that fill the rest of the volume."
2001,Prices that suit the times: Shopping for ceramics at the five points,"Throughout the 19th century, the area east of the Collect Pond was home to the immigrant poor. Primary documents offer one view of the crowded and dilapidated living conditions, which characterized the district known as “Five Points.” The ceramic assemblage excavated at the Foley Square Courthouse site in 1991 sheds a different light on the people and their way of life in New York’s most notorious slum. Sets of Staffordshire tea and tableware, as well as Chinese porcelain, are present in the assemblage. Issues relating to the procurement and availability of seemingly fancy ceramics and their meaning to the mid-century Irish tenants who used them are explained. Meaning is considered in terms of Irish cultural traditions and middle-class Victorian values. The CC index value of the large ceramic assemblage is also compared to CC values for other assemblages from New York City and elsewhere and the implications of the differences are considered."
2001,"Prostitutes, a Rabbi, and a carpenter-dinner at the five points in the 1830s","Three deposits from two separate shaft-features on Manhattan’s Block 160 yielded a total of 14,502 bones and bone fragments. Located in the middle of a working-class neighborhood, this block made up one-fifth of New York’s notorious Five Points. Analysis of the faunal assemblages, in tandem with the extensive historical record, provides an opportunity to explore working-class diet in a changing urban marketplace. Specific to Five Points, this is an examination of some of the disparate lifestyles present in this infamous neighborhood."
2001,Good for what ails you: Medicinal use at five points,"During the 19th century, residents of Five Points, Manhattan, lived in increasingly crowded, unsanitary conditions and often labored at dangerous and debilitating jobs. While wealthier city inhabitants could afford a healthy diet, a physician’s care, or a seasonal change of residence, medicine was the solitary option for the less fortunate. This study utilizes a large assemblage of medicinal vessels and archaeobotanical remains to examine the reality of disease in the Sixth Ward, the available choices for treatment, and the preferences of the Five Points population. Comparisons are made with medicinal choices at other 19th-century New York sites and some tentative conclusions are drawn about working-class versus middle-class behavior regarding health."
2001,“Material Culture”: Conservation and analysis of textiles recovered from five points,"The Five Points/Courthouse archaeological project benefited at its inception from the inclusion of conservation. Retrieval techniques facilitated the initial preservation of the many textile fragments in the assemblage and subsequent conservation was used to retrieve the weave structure and other diagnostic elements of the badly degraded materials. The treatments provided a unique opportunity to access information pertaining to one of the most important occupations for the Irish immigrants who lived in the neighborhood. This study describes the environmental conditions that produced the degradation and the techniques used to restore the textiles. In combination with historical research on the garment industry and the reuse of rags, textiles provide insights into working-class clothing, the redefinition of women’s roles in the workplace, and the impact of the Industrial Revolution on New York."
2001,"“By virtue of reason and nature”: Competition and economic strategy in the needletrades at New York’s Five Points, 1855–1880","During the 19th century, New York City became the largest producer of ready-to-wear clothing in America. This was possible, in part, because of the large labor force created by the influx of thousands of Irish, German, Polish, and Italian immigrants willing to work long hours for low wages in sweatshops and doing piece work in their own homes. Divided along the lines of gender and ethnic identity, men and women, Irish and Polish, competed for every penny they earned. New York’s Five Points neighborhood is known historically for its large population of immigrants who worked in the needletrades. Using the historical and archaeological data collected from the Five Points/Courthouse site, this study examines the sewing trades from the perspective of gender and ethnicity, with attention to differences in industrial and domestic deposits."
2001,"“Suckers, soap-locks, irishmen and plug-uglies”: Block 160, municipal politics and local control","The Irish immigrants who arrived in the United States and settled in lower Manhattan during the 19th century were poor and powerless, subject to the vagaries of an unfeeling world. Among these immigrants were the residents of Block 160, the site of a new federal courthouse at Foley Square. The Irish were able to gain a measure of power and control over their lives by entering into the political arena. Starting out as outcasts, then as hangers-on, these people gradually gained a voice in how their neighborhood should be run. Politics provided a way for ambitious young men of the neighborhood, who were barred by lack of education or opportunity to get into one of the “learned professions,” to make a living, and even become wealthy. This study focuses on the role of local politics-including the power and influence of Tammany Hall-on the lives of the residents of Block 160 during the 19th century. It sketches how the residents were able to access power, and then profit from it."
2001,Negotiating patriotism at the five points: Clay tobacco pipes and patriotic imagery among trade unionists and nativists in a nineteenth-century New York Neighborhood,"Nineteenth-century American trade union and nativist rhetoric was rife with allusions to nationalist and patriotic sentiments, and symbols of the Republic were prominently displayed whenever these groups congregated. American trade union heraldry also incorporated these motifs, explicitly linking democratic imagery with group identity. The concepts of identity and ideology bound up with patriotic symbols are contentious by nature, however. Trade unions defined their own republican and patriotic ideals while nativists deployed the same symbols within a very different ideological framework, yet both groups laid claim to a patriotic identity. The process of defining and negotiating the nature of patriotism and American national identity is explored through a hermeneutic approach, using tobacco pipes recovered from New York City’s Five Points/Courthouse site. This study addresses the extent to which the rhetoric and ideology of these groups penetrated the daily lives of individuals, many of whom are otherwise absent from the historical record."
2001,The rhetoric of reform: The five points missions and the cult of domesticity,"For 150 years, the Five Points has been depicted as New York’s center of vice and debauchery. Recent historical and archaeological investigations conclude that while the area contained abysmal sanitary conditions, poverty, and prostitution, many of the oft-told stories of the Five Points’ depravity are gross exaggerations. This article examines how literature produced by 19th-century missionaries and moral reformers helped create these myths. Throughout these works, the Five Points symbolized the immorality of urban life and was used to show middle-class readers the importance of their own ideology of domesticity. The reformers exaggerated the area’s poverty and stereotyped its inhabitants to illustrate the consequences of not adhering to middle-class principles of respectability and domesticity. By creating a sensational and one-sided image of urban poverty, writers created a stereotype of 19th-century working-class neighborhoods that would survive into the mid-20th century."
2001,Historical archaeology adrift?,"This commentary cites the remarkable progress made in the field of historical archaeology during the time since the founding of The Society for Historical Archaeology in 1967. Despite new sophistication in the technical aspects of the discipline, we have witnessed a perplexing tendency to focus research on unique events and thus have largely abandoned the search for the regularities of cultural practice. It is suggested that if historical archaeology is to achieve its full potential as a discipline, it must develop a methodology which draws from its unique strengths. The opposition of archival and archaeological data sets in the context of scientific inquiry is recommended."
2001,Attaining the full potential of historical archaeology,"Historical archaeology is not adrift; rather through the collective contributions of generations of dedicated scholars it has matured into an inclusive discipline that seeks solutions to a wide range of problems regarding past peoples and their cultural expressions. While it is appropriate to seek to understand cultural regularities we must also explore the rich texture of variation expressed in the material patterns left behind. I agree with Charles E. Cleland’s that new and rigorous methodologies must develop in order for historical archaeology to reach its potential. We need not constrain our creativity, however, nor the potential of thorough utilization of archival sources, by limiting ourselves to the construction of oppositions between the historical and archaeological record. Rather, our models should embrace an examination, and testing, of questions derived from the intersection of both sources of information. The full engagement of both history and archaeology in the framing of questions will lead to a more complete understanding of the dynamic nature of cultural expressions recoverable through archaeological inquiry."
2001,"The archaeology of a “Destroyed” Site: Surface survey and historical documents at the civilian conservation corps camp, bandelier national monument, New Mexico","Archaeological records and historical documents provide complementary data for the understanding of temporary laborers’ quarters related to large-scale construction projects. In this work, documents are used to evaluate data from an archaeological surface survey of a large 1930s era work camp of the Civilian Conservation Corps in northern New Mexico. The camp, occupied for seven years, was bulldozed immediately after its occupants left. Despite this drastic step, surface remains are still visible, and the site was recorded in 1990 and 1991 as part of a long-term survey project at Bandelier National Monument. Artifacts, rubble, and altered vegetation patterns constitute the known archaeological remains of the site and form the basis for the identification of activity areas. Historic maps and photographs complement artifact analysis and vegetation studies to illustrate the camp’s configurations."
2001,"The transformation of america: Georgian sensibility, capitalist conspiracy, or consumer revolution?","Over the last three decades, the Colonial Chesapeake has been a particularly dynamic field of archaeological study. In concert with the findings of the “new social history,” dramatic social and cultural developments have been documented, and a number of theoretical models have been advanced as explanatory constructs. Three popular models are critically evaluated: the “Georgian” worldview proposed by James Deetz, a theory of merchant capitalism most strongly championed by Mark Leone, and a transplanted “consumer revolution” espoused by Cary Carson and others. While significant points of congruence exist among the models, the consumer revolution concept will be argued as possessing the best potential to provide a solid theoretical basis for future insights. This proposition is based on a synthesis of archaeological and documentary findings, which indicate two broad phases of cultural transformation that appear most plausibly explained as the rise of a consumer society within the context of the American frontier."
2001,Correlates of contact: Epidemic disease in archaeological context,"Over the past several decades, historians, geographers, demographers, anthropologists and others interested in the demographic effects of contact between Europeans and Native Americans have emphasized epidemic diseases as a major factor in declining native populations. Little progress, however, has been made toward developing a method and theory for testing hypotheses regarding epidemic diseases and depopulation in the archaeological record. Tatham Mound, an early contact period mortuary locality in Florida serves as a useful example of the difficulties encountered when testing propositions regarding epidemic disease in archaeological context."
2001,Commodity flow and national market access: A case study from interior alaska,"This study re-examines the Commodity Flow Model presented by Riordan and Adams (1985) in light of additional work done by other archaeologists working in Illinois, Oregon, and South Carolina. The Commodity Flow Model provides a way for historical archaeologists to evaluate the interactions between manufacturer and consumer, by categorizing the consumer’s participation in the national market economy. The model is then tested using early 20th century gold rush sites in interior Alaska. Using both weighted and unweighted samples, this study reaffirms the validity of the model and suggests ways of improving it."
2001,"Provenience of eighteenth-century british porcelain sherds from sites 3b and 4e, fortress of Louisbourg, Nova Scotia: Constraints from mineralogy, bulk paste, and glaze compositions","Twenty-six British porcelain sherds excavated from two properties at the Fortress of Louisbourg were analysed by electron microprobe with the objective of identifying the factories from which they originated (that is, their provenience). Nineteen of the samples are phosphatic; seven are magnesian. Sixteen of the phosphatic sherds have paste and glaze compositions consistent with Bow porcelain (ca. 1747 to 1776). This attribution is supported by underglaze blue patterns (Dragon, Cannonball, and Desirable Residence patterns) and famille rose overglaze polychrome designs that match the decoration used on Bow porcelain. A calcic plagioclase-bearing sherd has a composition suggesting derivation from the Gilbody works (Liverpool, ca. 1755 to 1761). Another unassigned sherd has a paste composition that resembles products of the Lowestoft factory (ca. 1757 to 1799), but contains plagioclase, a mineral not known to occur in Lowestoft porcelain, and its glaze contains small amounts of tin, a component unknown in analysed Lowestoft glazes. One highly porous sample has an anomalous composition (a lower phosphate content than any known bone-ash porcelain), and appears to have been chemically modified in the ground. It, too, remains unattributed. The magnesian sherds contain diopside and enstatite, and thus are mineralogically similar to another type of Liverpool porcelain (late Chaffers [ca. 1756 to 1765]) and its successor, the Christian/Seth Pennington works; ca. 1765 to 1799). Compositionally, the body and glaze of these samples resemble Chaffers/Christian/Seth Pennington porcelain. This attribution is further supported by their underglaze blue patterns, which match some of those (Liver Bird pattern) known to have been used at the Liverpool works. Contemporary documents record the fact that the Bow works exported significant amounts of its wares to North America. The discovery of Chaffers/Christian/Seth Pennington porcelain at Louisbourg and other archaeological sites in Atlantic Canada (Fort Beauséjour) indicates that some Liverpool factories also supplied colonial markets with porcelain."
2001,Breaking bread with the dead,"The establishment of two international ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, and the creation of an International Criminal Court within the next five years, has increased the need for archaeologists who can assist in the exhumation of individual and mass graves associated with war crimes and genocide throughout the world. This work examines the efforts of teams of archaeologists and forensic scientists which have investigated forced disappearances, political killings, and war crimes in Argentina, Guatemala, Iraqi Kurdistan, and the former Yugoslavia since 1984. As more archaeologists enter this growing field, it is becoming apparent that their training at the university and post-graduate level needs to be supplemented with courses that will better prepare them for international forensic work. Not only do they need to be trained in forensic methods and procedures, they also need to be knowledgeable of legal and evidenciary procedures and the political and cultural dynamics of the countries where they will be working."
2001,Archaeology and forensic death investigations,"Historically, the role of the archaeology in forensic death investigation has focused on excavation techniques and documentation of context. Additional skills of the archaeologist relate to familiarity with stratigraphy and soils, collection and conservation of artifacts, and special areas of interest, such as taphonomy. The following discussion surveys the processes by which the methods and personnel of archaeology have been incorporated into forensic recovery of skeletal and buried remains. The current status of the archaeologist’s involvement in forensic investigations is explored. As well, distinctions between the work of medical legal death investigators and crime scene investigators are contrasted to archaeologists working conventional archaeological sites. Finally, the utility of archaeological methods and archaeologists is illustrated using examples ranging from a serial murder investigation in the U.S. to international investigations involving human rights abuses in Honduras and war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. The contributions of the archaeologist’s skills range from methodologies of excavation and documentation of context to expertise in areas involving soil features, conservation of grave goods, and the uses of taphonomic knowledge to resolve post-mortem issues."
2001,Why the forensic anthropologist needs the archaeologist,"Many scientific experts and specialists can be invited to join a forensic anthropology team and are used effectively in cases involving missing persons and buried homicide victims, as well as in locating historic burials. Nevertheless, the most significant addition to a forensic anthropology team is the archaeologist. The archaeologist is often instrumental in solving the puzzle of the burial’s location, which can lead to resolving the riddle of the deceased person’s identification and cause of death. This specialist’s training and experience with various soils and the environmental context surrounding buried or scattered remains makes his services invaluable to the leader of a well-rounded and successful forensic team. This article highlights the importance of archaeological expertise and its use in the forensic investigation."
2001,Bad to the bone?: Historical archaeologists in the practice of forensic science,"Heightened recognition by law enforcement personnel of forensic archaeology provides an expanding array of opportunities for historical archaeologists to apply their skills in situations of medicolegal significance. Yet too few archaeologists are familiar with the protocols of criminalistics, including crime scene processing, chains of custody, and effective court testimony. Also, most archaeologists do not fully realize the health risks associated with handling decomposed human remains and the professional liability exposure inherent to a juridical investigation. As a group, historical archaeologists undoubtedly possess the skills and ethical disposition required of forensic scientists, but those who wish to offer their services as forensic experts must also be prepared to assume the serious responsibilities of doing so. This paper discusses the development of forensic archaeology, the specialized training that qualifies one to participate in a crime scene investigation, methods to reduce health risks and professional liability exposure, and the most effective approaches an historical archaeologist can follow to become certified as a forensic expert."
2001,The archaeology of contemporary mass graves,"The excavation of mass graves provides information and documentation for both human rights work and for forensic medico-legal investigations. Medico-legal documentation for the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a major reason for recent excavation of large mass graves in these countries. The mass grave excavations have been among the largest since World War II. The investigative teams incorporated professional archaeologists sensitized to medico-legal realities, to the realm of decomposed fleshed remains, and who exhibited flexibility in adapting techniques to the forensic context. This paper examines the forensic context of these excavations, the techniques the team developed, and presents a case study from Rwanda."
2001,Looking for a needle in a haystack: Developing closer relationships between law enforcement specialists and archaeology,"In the early evening of 20 July 1993, the body of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr. was found in Fort Marcy Park in Fairfax County, Virginia. The United States Park Police investigated the death and concluded that it was a suicide. Since that time, questions have been raised concerning the circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster’s death. Following continued speculation, two separate investigations were conducted by Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske and Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr. Each investigation included a search of the area where Mr. Foster’s body was found in an attempt to locate the bullet which caused Mr. Foster’s death, bone fragments from his skull, gun powder residue, and other evidence relevant to Mr. Foster’s death."
2001,"Firearms identification in support of identifying a mass execution at El Mozote, El Salvador","The Civil War in El Salvador was very violent. One particularly violent episode involved the destruction of the village of El Mozote and the killing of hundreds of inhabitants by government troops. Forensic investigation of one building, containing the remains of the village’s children, coupled with archaeological application of firearms identification processes demonstrated the victims were executed and not killed as the result of combat action as claimed by the government."
2001,Remote sensing applications in forensic investigations,"Forensic investigations concern locating, identifying, collecting, and cataloging physical evidence for the purpose of presenting it in court. One aspect of forensic investigations concerns locating clandestine evidence which is often concealed in the subsurface. This task is typically guided by information provided by informants (pathological liars), witnesses, psychics, and sometimes suspects. Resultant searches may be time consuming and frustrating to understaffed departments. Often such searches lead to excavations that destroy evidence. Any nondestructive method used to reduce the time spent on searches and excavations and to increase the probability of locating physical evidence are of prime interest to the law enforcement community. Remote sensing methods, which are nondestructive, are currently being applied with promising results in forensic investigations. Some of the more promising methods, including infrared, magnetics, electromagnetics, and ground penetrating radar are discussed. Remote sensing methods when properly applied can provide the forensic investigator tremendous savings in time and cost in the search for physical evidence. The forensic investigator must be educated to understand that there is no remote sensing method that will consistently find a body or physical evidence. These methods locate anomalous areas, and the cause of these anomalies will only be fully understood upon examination by others."
2000,Meaning (and) materiality: Rethinking contextual analysis through cellar-set houses,"In early 17th-century Virginia, three people constructed houses unlike anything built in the Chesapeake before or since. These earthfast structures, owned by men of the “better sort” and framed at the bottom of cellar holes, have thus far defied explanation because of interpretive constraints inherent in the positivist underpinnings of archaeological analysis. This article challenges these constraints by engaging the rich contexts highlighted in recent work by “storytelling” archaeologists through poststructural semiotics. Rather than search for a single driving factor that explains these houses, it is argued that it is only when one grapples with the complexity of the context that one can understand how these houses were constituted by/constitutive of their context."
2000,Pastores presence on the Southern High Plains of Texas,"The pastores were a little-known Hispanic sheep herding group who moved their sheep (and later their families) from north-central New Mexico into the Canadian River Valley of the Texas Panhandle from the early 1870s to the middle 1880s. Use and occupation of the adjacent Southern High Plains was thought not to have occurred. Local historians, however, placed pastores occupations both along the eastern escarpment and on the plateau of the Southern High Plains. Three archaeological sites far to the southeast of the pastores primary area of occupation were examined based on survey data for authenticity and implications for a better understanding of pastores land-use patterns and role in the settlement of this area."
2000,Finding the forge: Geographic visualization in archaeology,"Geographic Visualization (GVis) techniques are discussed as applied to a study of intra-site patterning at the Reed Gold Mine Blacksmith Shop near Georgeville, North Carolina. One of the questions under investigation by the sponsoring agencies (North Carolina Historic Sites in conjunction with the Gold History Corporation) pertained to the location of the forge. After excavations, no direct evidence of a forge, such as a masonry foundation or an oak anvil base, was discovered. When viewed spatially however, there are ample marker artifact data pointing to a forge area. These artifacts were mapped and analyzed using Geographic Visualization techniques. By using this technology to ask questions about the artifact patterning, a strong indication as to the location of the forge was discovered."
2000,"Drought as a factor in the Jamestown colony, 1607–1612","Landscape reconstructions are now common in historical archaeology but climatic reconstructions are still infrequent. Period accounts of the Jamestown colony’s first decade indicate considerable stress that has begged satisfactory explanation. A baldcypress tree-ring study was initiated as an independent means of climatic reconstruction in the lower Chesapeake region. The findings clearly document severe drought during the first years of the Jamestown colony. The implications of these findings enrich and clarify the first-person accounts of stress due to famine, poor water quality, intercultural hostility, and extreme mortality. The results also demonstrate the value of interdisciplinary studies in historical archaeology and should encourage more routine consideration of climate as a significant factor in the historical events of the United States."
2000,"“A brilliant and pleasant light”: Investigating the springfield gas machine system at Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate, Lexington, Kentucky","Recent historical and archaeological investigations related to the gas works at Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate, have revealed a unique and important lighting system. A self-contained gas generating unit, known as the Springfield Gas Machine, was installed at Ashland sometime during the last quarter of the 19th century. This unit generated gas from liquid gasoline to power lighting fixtures throughout the house. Self-contained gas generating units, powered by both gasoline and acetylene, were introduced in the mid-19th century, and offered alternative gas sources for individuals and businesses outside the reach of municipal gas works systems. These machines represent an important technical innovation and one with considerable social consequences. Although the Springfield machines were found in greater numbers in the northeastern states, they also were used throughout the Midwest and South."
2000,Forum,"Originally, the gorget was an element of medieval body armor designed to protect the neck. With the advent of gunpowder, armor became an encumbrance yet the gorget continued in diminutive form as a badge of officer’s rank. As Anglo-French colonial rivalries brought military alliances with Native Americans, the gorget and military rank as a “gorget Captain” were extended to prominent men of a tribe. Soon thereafter, fur traders adopted the metal gorget as a trade item. Archaeological investigations at Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site in North Dakota recovered gorget fragments which compositional analysis suggests are of bone china, made in 19th century Staffordshire potteries. These unprecedented gorgets may represent the fur company’s attempt to introduce a more colorful and cheaper substitute for silver or other metals of intrinsic value. These bone china gorgets are a dead twig on their family tree for they bore no issue. Yet they appear to represent the climax of an artifact whose function and meaning have evolved through time from a practical male accouterment to this fragile male ornament that was poorly conceived to complement the active lifestyle of the recipients."
2000,Culture bought: Evidence of creolization in the consumer goods of an enslaved Bahamian family,"Archaeologists working in the Caribbean have identified evidence of African continuities in the craft and architectural traditions of enslaved peoples. Less attention has been paid to the role of the abundant, European-produced goods that are also found in the homes of enslaved families. The material culture from one enslaved Bahamian family is explored here, looking at how European-produced goods were selected by enslaved Africans and imbued with meanings in the creation of a Creole culture. The family discussed lived on Clifton plantation, on the island of New Providence, and consisted of an African-born couple and their two island-born children. The enslaved population, due to the paternalistic attitudes of the plantation owner, enjoyed an unusual degree of access to island markets. Using analyses of ceramics and pipes recovered from the household, it is argued that African-based aesthetics directed the selection and composition of the artifacts recovered from the dwelling."
2000,Creolization and late nineteenth century Métis vernacular log architecture on the South Saskatchewan River,"The ethnogenesis of Métis peoples of the western Canadian plains and parklands involved a creolizing process in which cultural traits from many different groups were adopted. An analysis of Métis vernacular log architecture on the South Saskatchewan River illustrates this clearly with individual building components derived from a number of different sources. These structural features are likened to the words of Michif, the Métis language, and their analysis informs upon Métis history and cultural interactions. The final building form, however, can be understood only through the grammar by which it was constructed. This grammar is configured by a Métis worldview that is organic and unbounded. The applicability of a linguistic analogy for the study of creolization is emphasized throughout."
2000,From colonist to creole: Archaeological patterns of Spanish colonization in the new world,"Creolization theory has recently been adopted and adapted by archaeologists as a useful tool for the study of culture contact and culture change. Another term, acculturation, has a much longer history and appears to examine the same phenomena. An examination of how this approach was applied in the study of the development of a Hispanic creole culture demonstrates its utility regardless of the terminology used."
2000,Creolization and the borderlands,"A model of borderland culture is provided and the concept of creolization is placed within a borderland framework. Manipulation of social identities and affiliations is a daily occurrence in border areas and “creolization” can be seen as one possible outcome of such manipulation. Presentation includes: a definition for borderland and how it differs from a frontier, a discussion of why creolization should be treated as a part of culture contact studies, and examples of negotiated culture on the border with emphasis on the Minorcans of Spanish Florida. The final argument is that creole cultures are one variant of the many kinds of fluid, syncretic cultures that typically appear in border areas."
2000,The material and cognitive dimensions of creolization in nineteenth-century Jamaica,"Creolization is defined as a special form of ethnogenesis that in plantation contexts was a process through which social and material worlds were defined. Using colonial Jamaica as an example, ethnohistorical sources to suggest how creole identities were emically defined by and negotiated between populations of both European and African descent, and suggests how the process of creolization was manifested in the use of space, foodways, and general health of creole populations of both European and African descent."
2000,"Representing colonizers: An archaeology of creolization, ethnogenesis, and indigenous material culture among the Haida","Rather than reduce colonial encounters to a universal creolization process, creolization is examined as conflict between various colonial powers and indigenous groups with distinct social and resource organizations. The concept of ethnogenesis focuses analysis of creolization by probing colonial power relations and approaching material culture as the active negotiation of colonization and colonial inequality. The subject of analysis is indigenous objects that depict European colonizers; such material culture should provide a sensitive insight into indigenous perceptions of colonization and illuminate the relations between various colonizers and indigenous peoples throughout the world. This examination of material culture from the Haida of the Pacific Northwest demonstrates how one indigenous group developed distinctive strategies to negotiate colonial power relations."
2000,The intersections of Colonial policy and Colonial practice: Creolization on the eighteenth-century Louisiana/Texas frontier,"By the mid-18th century, the population that lived on the Louisiana/Texas frontier was comprised of French, Spanish, Native American, African, and creoles (or mixed-bloods). French and Spanish colonial policies dictated the kinds of social and economic relations that were to exist between people of different racial and ethnic groups on the frontier. Colonial practices often ran counter to official policies, however, as individuals crossed social and racial borders created by the Crown to construct not only multiethnic communities but also multiethnic households. This process of creolization resulted in the negotiation of new colonial identities for those that did not fit into neat colonial categories. Using ethnohistoric and archaeological data, the process of creolization that occurred within multiethnic communities and households along the colonial Louisiana/Texas border is considered."
2000,Creolization and the archaeology of multiethnic households in the American South,"Creolization was originally introduced to historical archaeology through the study of settler communities in Spanish Florida and African-American material culture recovered from plantations in the South Carolina lowcountry. Creolization is a productive concept for interpreting a diverse range of contexts in the South-particularly the multiethnic household. Creolization is briefly contextualized within ethnic or race relations theory within anthropology and sociology. Attention then turns to the archaeology and ethnography associated with multiethnic households. Multiethnic contexts considered consist of lowcountry plantations, settler households in Spanish Florida and the Caribbean, frontier residences in the South Carolina backcountry, Cherokee households in North Carolina, and multiracial communities in East Tennessee."
2000,Understanding cultural change through the vernacular: Creolization in Louisiana,"A diachronic examination of the emic meanings of “creole” in Louisiana reveals a dynamic and complex social identity that is not easily dissected into the etic (or Anglo-American emic) categories of race, class, or ethnicity. In fact, outsider misconceptions about Louisiana creoles have been incorporated into recent anthropological definitions of creolization. This study explores the vernacular understandings of creole through three generational shifts in Louisiana spanning the early-18th through mid-19th centuries. A comparison of these vernacular definitions with the results of archaeological excavations at two creole sites in New Orleans helps define three types of creolization: transplantation, ethnic acculturation, and hybridization. These are transitions that occurred in the self-fashioning of Louisianans as expressed through their houses, gardens, clothes, food, and household goods. Adopting a native perspective exposes the roles that worldview and individual agency play in shaping processes of cultural change."
2000,"Imaginary, but by no means unimaginable: Storytelling, science, and historical archaeology","“Imaginary, But by No Means Unimaginable,” a phrase coined by L. Daniel Mouer and Ywone Edwards-Ingram at the 1998 Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology, epitomizes a new approach to archaeological analysis and public interpretation. The suddenness with which examples of storytelling appeared in conferences and publications has left little opportunity for comment, particularly to address the theoretical and methodological issues that underlie this hybrid of science, humanities research, and artistic expression. This commentary suggests that storytelling is more than a means of engaging public audiences: it is a form of archaeological analysis."
2000,The historic and paleoclimatic significance of log buildings in Southcentral Texas,"Tree-ring dating has been applied to eight historic log buildings in southcentral Texas. The historic tree-ring chronologies derived from these buildings are combined with chronologies from living trees to create an improved and extended tree-ring record dating from A.D. 1649 to 1995 that is sensitive to regional and large-scale climate change. This extended chronology is significantly correlated with meteorological measurements of growing season moisture supply in Texas, and with the episodic influence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Tree-ring dating provides insight into the history and archaeology of these buildings. Historic structures also preserve crucial paleoclimatic data that can provide unique information about environmental and cultural history. Sadly, these historic structures are rapidly vanishing from the Texas landscape."
2000,“The little spots allow’d them”: The archaeological study of African-American yards,"Yards, like buildings and more portable artifacts, are significant expressions of culture. Yet within African-American archaeology, yards have not been the focus of serious discussions addressing questions of work and leisure activities, community interactions, aesthetics, and culture change. The authors review archaeological, ethnographic, and historical evidence of yards associated with New World slave quarters and present a framework for analysis. Results of recent excavations at a slave quarter at Poplar Forest in central Virginia, occupied from ca. 1790 to 1812, are presented within the context of this framework. The archaeological study of yard spaces provides significant information about cultural meanings and uses of space."
2000,Lash’s: A bitter medicine: Biochemical analysis of an historical proprietary medicine,"Patent medicines were widely used during the late 1800s and early 1900s. Bitters were one important subtype of patent medicines that were typically made from extracts of bitter tasting herbs. Lash’s Bitters was a popular patent medicine that was advertised as an extract of the bark of the buckthorn tree, Rhamnus purshiana, and was sold as a laxative. Analysis of the contents of an undisturbed bottle of Lash's Bitters, ca. 1918, revealed an ethanol content of 19.2% by volume as well as trace amounts of methanol. Potentially toxic concentrations of lead, 295 mg/dl, were also found. Interestingly, the medicine contained none of the active ingredient found in Rhamnus purshiana."
2000,"There’s gold in them thar— documents? The demographic evolution of Nevada’s Comstock, 1860 through 1910, and the intersection of census demography and historical archaeology","The premise of this work is that the interpretation of historic communities is most effective when it is derived from both the physical evidence and the written record. As an introduction to the use of manuscript censuses by archaeologists, the purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it will explain the uses of manuscript censuses in historical archaeology as well as their limitations. Second, it will provide an example of the uses of these data sources. Third, it will offer a simple model for historical archaeology based on these data. To this end, the demographic evolution of Nevada’s Comstock from 1860 though 1910 is examined in order to both explain potential uses of census materials and to provide a baseline for understanding population processes on the Comstock in particular, and mining communities in the Inter-Mountain West during this time period. The paper concludes that census data are integral to understand demographic processes at a particular point in time, examining trends through time, and portraying an historical community."
2000,Magnetometer prospecting in historical archaeology: Evaluating survey options at a 19th-century rancho site in California,"To complement the growing literature on magnetic prospection in historical archaeology, the practical aspects of magnetometer selection and survey design need to be explored. Based on a test case from the Petaluma Adobe State Historic Park in northern California, two readily-available magnetometers are compared with respect to instrument type (alkali-vapor versus proton precession), sensor configuration and number (total field versus vertical gradient), sensor height, intensity of data collection, and basestation correction procedures. These variables are then considered in light of survey speed, labor input, and monetary cost. Results indicate that the alkali-vapor gradiometer is better suited for historical archaeological research based on survey speed and efficiency, volume of data collected, temporal and spatial intensity of station readings, and sensor sensitivity. In addition, the data reconfirm the importance of sensor height, gradiometer configuration, and basestation correction in obtaining high-quality magnetic data."
2000,Theoretical and methodological considerations for excavating privies,"Excavation within privies by arbitrary 10-cm (4 in.) levels is often a necessity because of time and space constraints. However, when archaeologists invest the extra effort to remove privy deposits by natural and cultural strata, they reap great benefits in terms of interpreting construction, use, and maintenance behaviors and in elucidating attitudes about hygiene and sanitation. This work outlines some of the advantages of reconstructing site formation processes (e.g., construction, use, maintenance, and abandonment) within privy shafts from sites in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The author offers recommendations on how to excavate individual deposits using both the profile and the single-layer plan of the Harris matrix and “side-access” excavation."
2000,"Filth, garbage, and rubbish: refuse disposal, sanitary reform, and nineteenth-century yard deposits in Washington, D. C.","To the archaeologist, the refuse deposits found on domestic sites are a source of information about diet, health, and consumer behavior. Yet to 19th-century health reformers, these deposits were regarded as sources of disease causing offensive odors, or “noxious effluvia.” Thus, city officials in Washington first instituted night soil collection (privy contents), then garbage collection (organic refuse), and finally by century’s end, rubbish collection (inorganic refuse). Concurrently, city officials passed ever stricter nuisance laws designed to enforce public health policy. How these reforms were enforced, and how the public reacted to them, may say much about the development of attitudes towards cleanliness. Excavations from domestic sites in Washington, D. C. show that refuse disposal practices differed substantially from house to house. The adoption of sanitary practices was far from even, and may have been associated with many factors, including cultural background, occupation, and home ownership, among others."
2000,"Out of sight, out of mind: Privy architecture and the perception of sanitation","This study examines privy vault architecture, an often underutilized piece of archaeological evidence, to provide another line of evidence for understanding perceptions of sanitation in mid 19th to early 20th-century Louisville, Kentucky. Specific architectural attributes of privy vaults are analyzed in relation to ordinances that regulated the construction of these features. The vault depth, materials used in construction, method of construction, and their proximity to water sources are analyzed. This analysis reveals that misguided sanitary perceptions affected the ordinances pertaining to sanitary issues and the compliance of the ordinances by the public, which were manifested in the way privy vaults were constructed. The intention of this research is to demonstrate the utility of privy vault architecture as archaeological information and to illustrate the potential of interpreting archaeological data in specific contexts. By interpreting the same archaeological information in different contexts, we can begin to understand the multiple meanings of objects in the past, leading to a better understanding of past culture."
2000,Interpreting the latrines of the Johnson’s Island Civil War Military Prison,"Investigations of the prison compound latrines from the Johnson’s Island Civil War Military Prison site provide a unique opportunity to explore a multitude of questions related to military life and POW treatment during the American Civil War. Johnson’s Island (Ohio), a Union prison for Confederate officers, contained special use areas within the compound and their associated latrines which can be evaluated chronologically. Coupled with the extensive primary documentation existing for this prison, investigations to date have centered around how these unique latrines exhibit both the POW experience as well as changing Union policy towards prisoners. These latrines captured lost items, were the repository for primary and secondary deposits reflecting the material culture available to the prisoner at the time, and served as the staging areas for escape attempts."
2000,The social organization of a boardinghouse: Archaeological evidence from the Buffalo waterfront,"A contextual analysis of three privies excavated on the Buffalo waterfront yielded information about the structure of daily life in a 19th-century urban environment. The study of these features included the analysis of their structure and artifact content, as well as extensive investigation of the documentary record. This research afforded the opportunity to examine the distinctions between boarders and families in a boardinghouse context. Privies associated with a saloon/boardinghouse were compared with evidence from a single family home. The archaeological evidence suggested the differential use of teawares by the boardinghouse family as a means of distinguishing the familial unit within the larger boardinghouse population. Analysis also indicated that the boardinghouse family enjoyed a somewhat higher standard of living than the neighboring single family household."
2000,The Parity of privies: Summary research on privies in North Carolina,"Outdoor latrines have been recorded in North Carolina from a variety of historic sites. Though the function remains the same, their location, architecture, and subsequent contents evidence considerable variation. This paper presents the survey results of archaeologically-recorded privy pits, their contents, and their cultural interpretation. Also included in this study is information gathered from statewide architectural surveys of sites with extant privy buildings. To augment the archaeological and architectural data sets, historical information is abstracted from early State Board of Health records and other public documents. A summary of architectural attributes from the privies reflects the change in structure and sanitation of these buildings against an historical backdrop. The convergence of these privy attributes is offered as a guide to future archaeological investigations and historical preservation projects through use of predictability models."
2000,"Sanitation practices, depositional processes, and interpretive contexts of Minneapolis Privies","Throughout the 19th century the rear yards of both urban residences and commercial establishments included wells, cisterns, and privies dedicated to the supply and storage of water and the disposal and management of wastes. As municipal services were introduced these facilities were abandoned. The manner in which these facilities were used, and then subsequently filled, is critical to understanding historic sanitation practices. Further, the analysis of depositional processes is important in defining the interpretive contexts of the artifact assemblages recovered from such features. This paper presents an analysis of sanitation practices and depositional processes for features recently investigated at two sites in downtown Minneapolis. The processes resulting in the deposition of artifact assemblages are examined, and the behavioral implications of these findings for interpreting artifact assemblages are discussed. The general state of 19th-century sanitation practices in Minneapolis and the extent of compliance with public health regulations are also considered. It is argued that careful consideration of the character and associative contexts of urban artifact assemblages is necessary to any analytical or interpretive process."
1999,Rural modernization during the recent past: Farmstead archaeology in the Aiken Plateau,"Modernization theory is studied as a vehicle for interpreting archaeological resources of the recent past. During the period when many farmers were adopting mechanized equipment and new technologies for the home, the federal government purchased property from landowners in the Aiken Plateau of South Carolina to create a nuclear research facility. As a consequence, all farms in the study area were abandoned in 1951. This event created an opportunity for studying rural lifeways during a period when modernization was restructuring agriculture in North America. Analysis of the built environment in the study area indicates that very few of the dwellings resembled the modern-styled homes that were emerging across the nation by 1950. Despite the paucity of evidence for modern farm dwellings, archaeological analyses indicate that most rural households were purchasing numerous commercially produced goods. Contrasting information thus illustrates the often uneven character of culture change and historical process."
1999,"Production of animal commodities at Plum Grove, Iowa City","To understand how people living in rural areas articulated with larger systems of commodities networks it is important to study them not just as consumers of goods, but also as producers of commodities. Based on historical and ethnohistorical comparisons, a late-19th-century feature at the Plum Grove site in Johnson County, Iowa, displays archaeological evidence of the production of animals for market sale despite a lack of historical records from this time period. The nature of this evidence is discussed, as is its significance in understanding Plum Grove’s articulation with macro-level economic networks."
1999,Portuguese tin-glazed earthenware in seventeenth-century New England: A preliminary study,"An examination of documentary and archaeological evidence for the distribution and use of Portuguese tin-glazed earthenware in 17th-century New England. This type of ware is commonly found in excavations but its significance has been overlooked. Its presence marks a period of intensified Anglo-Portuguese trade in which New England merchants played an important role. Insular and mainland Portugal imported New England codfish and wood products and exported wine, fruit, salt, oil, and tin-glazed earthenware. New England sites contribute new information to refine the dating and classification of these ceramics, consisting mainly of plates and bowls. Their disappearance from New England by the late 17th century may have been due to enforcement of the Navigation Acts and ascent of the British ceramic industry. Typologies for the forms and decoration of these 17th century tin-glazed earthenwares are presented."
1999,The metropolis and the backcountry: The making of a colonial landscape on the South Carolina frontier,"The colonial settlement of South Carolina in the 18th century resulted in the emergence of two largely separate economies, the organization of which gave rise to distinctive frontier landscapes. The commercial rice economy of the Lowcountry was characterized by dispersed plantation production facilitated by riverine transportation. The urban functions of this largely rural landscape were centered on entrepôt of Charleston, a city whose size and material wealth reflected the region’s commercial success. The Backcountry initially lacked access to the entrepôt’s urban and export markets and its regional isolation fostered insular economic institutions dispersed among smaller nucleated settlements linked by overland routes. Commercial investment by Charleston interests eventually established the infrastructure of specialized production in the Backcountry and incorporated its resources in the larger export economy. The settlement system that emerged in the interior reflected these changes, but did not emulate the Lowcountry. Rather, it bore the imprint of the frontier landscape, components of which merely acquired new roles as regional nodes in South Carolina’s expanding economy, the focus of which remained the older entrepôt that emerged as the South’s major port in the post-frontier period."
1999,Gentility and material culture on the Carolina Frontier,"Both travelers’ accounts and historiographic portrayals of the colonial southern Backcountry emphasize the paucity of material culture and the lack of refined manners of the inhabitants. Recent research at the South Carolina frontier settlement of New Windsor Township demonstrates that this stereotypical view of backsettlers is false. Archaeological material culture, probate inventory data, and contemporary letters strongly indicate that frontier settlers not only bought high-status goods associated with refinement and gentility, but they also understood the behavioral patterns associated with them. This new perspective suggests that gentility often associated with 19th-century antebellum cotton planters actually had roots in the early colonial history of the frontier. More importantly, gentility contained and directed relationships in the Backcountry in ways reminiscent of Lowcountry society."
1999,"“An idea of grandeur”: Furnishing the classical interior in Charleston, 1815–1840","To understand the information received from recovered archaeological material and what it reveals about the spread of refinement in 19th-century America, it is important to place it within the broader context of its original setting. This work draws upon probate inventories and surviving material artifacts, such as homes, furniture, and decorative arts, to reconstruct the upper-class interior in Charleston, South Carolina, in the early antebellum period and illustrate the unique taste demonstrated by antebellum Charlestonians. As the lines that separated upper from middle class were becoming increasingly blurred, elite Charlestonians asserted cultural authority by maintaining an allegiance to the ideal of the English landed gentry. They emphasized their inheritance of an aristocratic order and constructed a material world that sought to identify themselves with European taste and culture. They traveled extensively in Europe acquiring art and objects with which they could ornament their homes and express their allegiance with European and classical culture, their liberal education, and, most importantly, their refined manners and taste."
1999,“After the Chinese taste”: Chinese export porcelain and chinoiserie design in eighteen-century Charleston,"Chinese export porcelain is one of the most commonly found ceramics in the Charleston area, constituting as much as 24% of the overall ceramic assemblage at many archaeological sites. Chinese porcelain was but one part, however, of a broader stylistic language known as Chinoiserie in the 18th century. As international trade expanded, the complete range of Asian export luxury goods—Chinese silks, Indian cotton textiles, Chinese lacquer and hardwood furniture, Chinese wallpaper, and reverse paintings on glass—became popular throughout the European world. The European enthusiasm for Asian export goods inspired western designers both technologically—with the invention of porcelain—and stylistically, as they combined Asian and European motifs in whimsical, Chinese-inspired designs for architecture and interior decoration. The more ephemeral objects, such as textiles and wallpaper, rarely survive in the archaeological record, although their presence can be established in period newspaper advertisements and probate inventories. As one of the wealthiest cities and most active trading centers in 18th-century North America, Charleston, South Carolina, provides rich documentation for the presence of Asian export luxury goods and Chinese-inspired designs in the American colonies. By importing these goods and ordering locally crafted objects in the Chinese taste, Charleston’s colonial gentry demonstrated their ability to emulate their European counterparts and adapt the latest European fashion to their own domestic interiors."
1999,"Pottery, intercolonial trade, and revolution: Domestic earthenwares and the development of an American social identity","The American colonists were a discontented lot from the beginning. Some were fleeing religious persecution, while others sought alternatives to their options in the homeland. When they arrived in North America many headed for the frontier, but many also settled in cities that served as collection points and shipping centers for a network of trade that extended far into the heartland. During the 18th century, manufacturing centers developed to process the skins, fibers, and minerals gathered in the interior. Colonists north and south, even though they faced different experiences, shared challenges that set them increasingly apart from their ancestral homelands. As a result, a unique social identity was being forged. The vastness of the land caused long-distance communications, facilitated by trade, to be the bond for social cohesion for both people on the frontier and people in the coastal cities. In the days before electronic communication, shipping was the fastest and most reliable medium for communication and trade between the major population centers. Although other manufactured goods, like textiles, were more important in economic terms, the trade of domestically produced earthenwares, easily visible in the archaeological record, serves as mute testimony to the development of a unique social identity, and the formation of this independent nation."
1999,A Trans-Atlantic merchant’s house in Charleston: Archaeological exploration of refinement and subsistence in an urban setting,"A century after its founding in 1670, Charleston, South Carolina, was the wealthiest city per capita in the British colonies. The city’s richest merchants and planters proclaimed their achieved status through material possessions as well as actions. Archaeological research in Charleston has explored the homes of several elite community members, most recently that of Nathaniel Russell (ca.1808). Data from Russell’s house, supplemented with those from 20 other urban sites, are used to explore the issues of refinement, landscape development, and ethnic relations in an urban setting."
1999,"Slave and servant housing in Charleston, 1770–1820","Studies of Charleston, South Carolina, architecture and archaeology tend to focus on the artifacts and landscapes of the city’s white populace. This essay builds on the growing wealth of archaeologically recovered African-American material culture and initiates a discussion on Charleston’s slave quarters and their settings."
1999,Historical archaeology in the next millenium: A forum,"Historical archaeologists should focus their future research efforts on a set of central problems surrounding the emergence of the modern world. Such problems include environmental change, technological change, ethnogenesis, and distinctive patterns of social interaction. Professionalism is an additional issue discussed."
1999,Interpreting archaeological data through correspondence analysis,"Correspondence Analysis, a multivariate analytical technique, provides a valuable tool for archaeological analysis. Correspondence Analysis is here applied to data recovered from 27 seasons of extensive archaeological excavations at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, a frontier military post constructed in 1820. The artifact distributions and rich documentary record delineate patterns in the functional, social, and economic meaning assigned to different areas of the fort. Through the use of a model of military site characteristics, which served as a set of testable hypotheses, Correspondence Analysis results helped define functional distinctions within the military complex as elements of the social structure of the setting and enhance the anthropological understanding of economic and social status differentiation in 19th century military posts. The results show that Correspondence Analysis’ unique manner of display of data tables can serve as a heuristic device that can assist archaeologists to focus and refine research efforts."
1999,Tarapaya: An elite Spanish residence near colonial Potosí in comparative perspective,"Research at a variety of Spanish colonial settlements in the circum-Caribbean region (Deagan 1983, 1988; Ewen 1991) has revealed consistent patterns in the types and proportions of indigenous and European artifacts in domestic assemblages. These results have suggested that acculturative processes influenced largely by gender were the standard adaptive response throughout the Spanish colonial world. Excavations at colonial sites in Peru by Rice and Smith (Rice and Smith 1989; Smith 1991, 1997) and in Bolivia by the author have yielded assemblages, however, which are differently structured and include much larger proportions of locally produced goods, including a wide variety of ceramics. These findings indicate that there were regional differences in the degree to which colonists incorporated indigenous technology into their domestic activities, a divergence that was influenced largely by local geographic and historical conditions."
1999,Introduction: Why confront class?,"At a luncheon with a dozen colleagues from other universities recently, I found myself alone questioning the statement “Everyone knows the working class is dead”! “How can that be,” I asked, “when there are people serving us lunch here, washing dishes, and cooking in a hot kitchen behind those doors? Don’t you mean that class relations have shifted globally and nationally and that it is harder for academics to discuss class issues according to traditional terms”? The immediate silence around the table showed that the directness of this challenge was perceived as rude—or was it the class knowledge that was unsayable? (Rimstead 1996:126)."
1999,Internalizing class in historical archaeology,"Historical archaeologists have either ignored class or defined it as a category or objective entity. In this work, it is argued that viewing class as a formation provides a powerful tool for studying the past. Defining class in this way stems from a theory of internal relations that sees class as a relational, analytical concept that operates at more than one scale or level of abstraction. Two examples demonstrate the class dynamics in different social and historic contexts. The first focuses on class at the community level, while the second looks at the class structure within a single household. Only through the process of abstracting class in real historic contexts can we operationalize class as an analytical concept powerful enough to understand internal social relations."
1999,"Race and the genteel consumer: Class and African-American consumption, 1850–1930","Between the Civil War and the 1920s, a consumer culture emerged which attempted to evade class tension by focusing on contrived racial differences. The vast majority of American-born whites and European immigrants alike embraced the illusion of a classless consumer culture in which opportunity was available to white citizens alone. African Americans were caricatured as being racially unsuited to those citizen privileges in consumption and labor space. Archaeological assemblages from Annapolis, Maryland demonstrate, however, that African-American consumers actively sought the opportunities consumer culture promised and articulated an anti-racist class struggle in consumer space."
1999,The archaeology of middle-class domesticity and gentility in Victorian Brooklyn,"In 1995, John Milner Associates excavated three privies and four cisterns dating to the 1860s at the Atlantic Terminal Urban Renewal Area in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, New York. Residents associated with the deposits were members of the burgeoning white-collar middle class. Examinations of the recovered ceramic and glass vessels, as well as children’s toys and household furnishings, show that these middle-class households used material culture to create what contemporaries referred to as a “genteel” lifestyle. By setting their tables with specific ceramic wares and vessels, these families both advertised their “respectability” to other families and taught their children the class-specific values needed to maintain their middle-class status. The analysis shows that each of the excavated households closely followed the contemporary advice literature on household furnishings and dining etiquette. Indeed, the similarities between the assemblages and conformity to the advice literature suggests that the desire to “keep up with the Joneses” and the corresponding insecurities commonly associated with the middle class during the 1950s and 1960s were firmly established one hundred years earlier."
1999,“Free from all vicious habits”: Archaeological perspectives on class conflict and the rhetoric of temperance,"American temperance organizations of the mid-19th century stressed total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, attributing to these substances an array of physically and morally damaging effects. These reformers deployed a rhetoric which was deeply rooted in middle-class American ideology, focusing their efforts on freeing impoverished, working-class, and immigrant groups from the bonds of addiction, demanding nothing less than total abstinence. Yet many middle-class partakers continued to smoke and drink in “moderate” amounts. The temperance movement became a locus for the exercise of class-based social control and opposition. Cultural, religious, and political agendas also animated the temperance debate and informed the philosophies of reformist institutions. The responses of diverse social groups to temperance reform are explored through an analysis of period documents and archaeological material from New York City and Lowell, Massachusetts, in order to explore the interplay of class formation, cultural and “racial” conflict, and religious ideology underlying reformist social movements."
1999,Go gCuire Dia Rath Agus Blath Ort (God grant that you prosper and flourish): Social and economic mobility among the Irish in Nineteenth-Century New York City,"In the past, many historical archaeologists have focused on measuring differences in ethnicity and class in a variety of different contexts. Usually, these studies attempt to quantify differences between groups based on artifact groups that may display social or economic diversion in consumer behavior. The 1991 excavation and subsequent analysis of the Five Points Archaeological Project in New York City has presented an opportunity to view the archaeology of a neighborhood composed of diverse social and economic groups living in close quarters. This work is an exploration of ways in which the archaeological and historical records may disclose varying class and ethnic behaviors within a neighborhood that would be traditionally characterized as “working class.”"
1999,"Examining gender, class, and ethnicity in Nineteenth-Century New York City","Ceramic vessels are used in a first step for comparing how working- and middle-class women constructed domesticity in 19th-century New York City. In addition to exploring some of the interpretive problems encountered in studying working-class families who lived in tenements, the analysis indicates that the women of the working class apparently did not emulate middle-class women when it came to choosing the dishes they used to set their tables."
1999,“A disregard of every sentiment of humanity”: The town farm and class realignment in Nineteenth-Century rural New England,"The development of the town farm was an important landmark in the reshaping of rural classes in 19th-century New England. Town authorities viewed the local institution as a means of distinguishing “worthy poor” members of the working class from those deemed merely lazy and idle. This work considers the relationship between the Smithfield, Rhode Island Town Farm and Asylum (1834–1870) and both the inhabitants of the institution and the more prosperous citizens of Smithfield. Archaeological evidence from the site, especially the ceramic assemblage, has raised questions concerning the reshaping of values among rural elites in an industrializing community. The final blow to the institution, an inquiry into allegations of abuse and mistreatment of inmates, provides a lens through which larger issues surrounding social reform can be examined, based on Smithfield’s all-too-typical experience with poor relief."
1999,The landscapes of class negotiation on coffee plantations in the blue mountains of Jamaica: 1790–1850,"Analyzing the material elements of class negotiation should be a focus of historical archaeology. One of the most promising forms of material culture with which to conduct such analysis is landscape. To examine how landscapes shaped the negotiation of class relations in 19th century Jamaica, the material remains of three coffee plantations—Sherwood Forest, Clydesdale, and Chesterfield—are described and analyzed. The archaeological analysis of the landscapes of 19th century class negotiation can shed light on the historical development of capitalist social processes, many of which still impact the negotiation of class relations today."
1999,Class confrontations in archaeology,"Archaeologist not only live class they also study it. Archaeology as a discipline serves class interests and as a profession, or occupation, it has its own class structure. The discipline of archaeology has, since its founding, primarily served middle-class interests. It has formed part of the symbolic capital that has been necessary for membership in the middle class during this century. Archaeology has traditionally reproduced itself in the university using a guild model of apprenticeship and mastery. In both the academy and in cultural resource management today this guild model has become an ideology that obscures the existence of an archaeological proletariat of teaching assistants, adjuncts, and field techs. The ideology justifies denying these archaeologists respect, a living wage, job security, and benefits. A seven step program is proposed to rectify the structural class inequalities of modern archaeology."
1999,Epilogue: Class analysis and historical archaeology,"Class analysis draws on the theoretical traditions of Marx and Weber to understand the densely structured, dynamic social relations of the post-Columbian world. Class analyses involves theoretical and empirical studies of class process, class structure, and class formation. The papers in this volume consider these various aspects of class analysis, particularly illuminating the intersections of race, class and gender, and the ongoing formation of the United States middle class."
1998,Memorial,"American temperance organizations of the mid-19th century stressed total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, attributing to these substances an array of physically and morally damaging effects.

1998,The lost flying boat of Kaneohe Bay: Archaeology of the first U. S. casualties of Pearl Harbor,"Can archaeology add to the narrative of the Japanese attack on the U. S. Naval and Air installations in Hawaii, 7 December 1941, or is this event too recent and historically well documented to benefit from the tools of archaeology? One answer to this question lies at the bottom of Kaneohe Bay, some 25 mi. (40 km) from the famed U. S. Naval base of Pearl Harbor. In June and July 1994, East Carolina University, the Marine Option Program of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and the National Park Service co-sponsored an unusual field school. The project called for a pre-disturbance survey and archaeological documentation of a sunken flying boat recently located by U. S. Marine Corps divers near the Naval Air Station in Kaneohe Bay on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu. Our purpose was to document and identify the abandoned craft and ascertain whether it had been destroyed as a result of the Japanese attack on Oahu, 7 December 1941. Yet the project achieved far more than this, revealing for the first time in 53 years what was not seen or heard through the smoke and thunder of that battle; a patrol crew’s gallant effort to save their craft."
1998,Acculturation and the composition of the diet of Tucson’s overseas Chinese gardeners at the turn of the Century,"Archaeological excavations in Tucson, Arizona, revealed portions of an overseas Chinese gardeners’ household that was occupied between 1892 and 1905. Several features, including two water storage barrels, an outdoor hearth, an activity surface, and trash-filled pits provided an abundance of macrobotanical and faunal information, and fragments of food cooking, storage, and service vessels. Analyses of the data suggest that the occupants of the household maintained a traditionally diverse diet by preparing new foodstuffs in traditional ways. Some imported Chinese foods were purchased, despite their probable high costs, helping to recreate meals eaten in the gardeners’ homeland."
1998,Seeing: The power of town planning in the Chesapeake,Urban planning in St. Mary’s City and Annapolis is argued to be guided by a baroque theory of power. The layouts of both cities use the same principles. Baltimore is argued to be built using a panoptic theory of power. Planning and building in these important Maryland cities was to promote and solidify hierarchy.
1998,"On the earliest products (ca. 1751–1752) of the Worcester porcelain manufactory: Evidence from sherds from the Warmstry House site, England","Ceramic sherds recovered from the lowest level of a waster pile at the Warmstry House site have diverse compositions. One sample was derived from a paste with the same major ingredients as later (mid-1750s to 1770s) Worcester porcelain but in different proportions, whereas others are significantly different (e.g., are comparatively P-rich and Mg+Pb-poor). The mildly phosphatic sherds were derived from a recipe containing bone ash and small amounts of flint glass frit, but no talc, a signature ingredient of Lund’s Bristol porcelain and later Worcester wares. Consequently, they are interpreted to predate Worcester’s annexation (21 February 1752) of the Bristol works. A compositionally transitional (Mg+P-rich, Pb-free) sherd is a hybrid ware that links the phosphatic samples with later, Mg+Pb-rich Worcester porcelain. These data suggest that Worcester’s early proprietors developed their own experimental pastes prior to adopting more Bristol-like recipes after February 1752. It is evident from the composition of the transitional sherd that they continued their experiments with phosphate-bearing pastes after they had knowledge of Bristol’s recipe."
1998,Metal detector use in archaeology: An introduction,"Metal detectors are simple, effective, and inexpensive remote sensing tools with real value to archaeologists. The archaeologists is presented an overview of how to use a metal detector and outlines the physical principles that govern metal detectors and their limits. Examples of the use of detectors in inventory, testing, and excavation are drawn from the literature and from the authors’ experience."
1998,Shifting sand and muddy water: Historic cartography and river migration as factors in locating steamboat wrecks on the far upper Missouri River,"Steamboating on the Missouri River began in 1819 and, by 1860 Fort Benton, Montana Territory was established as the world’s innermost port. Between 1819 and the mid-1920s more than 1,000 vessels were lost and subsequently forgotten on the Missouri River. Missouri River migration is investigated as a primary factor in predicting, locating, and assessing inland river wreck sites today. The study examines three historic river surveys conducted in 1867, 1874, and from 1892 to 1897, plus modern aerial photography for clues suggesting the location of steamboat wreck sites and information useful in predicting site conditions and site formation processes prior to archaeological disturbance."
1998,The central artery/tunnel project preservation program,"The Central Artery/Tunnel Project in Boston is the largest and most complex highway project ever undertaken in the core of a major American city. The project will replace an existing elevated highway, which passes through Boston’s historic downtown, with a new underground expressway. In 1984 a Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between transportation authorities and historic preservation agencies set stipulations designed to preserve and protect archaeological and historic resources within and adjacent to the project right-of-way. Started in the earliest planning stages of the project, the Central Artery/Tunnel Project Preservation Program implemented the MOA through historic structure survey and recording projects, review of future development plans, the Project Conservator Program to protect buildings during construction, and archaeological survey, site examination, and data recovery. The program has surveyed over 450 historic structures, developed guidelines and specifications for protection of potentially impacted historic structures, provided criteria for building and construction monitoring programs, identified and recovered four National Register eligible archaeological sites, and conducted a public information and education program."
1998,Great expectations: The public interpretation program for the Central Artery/Tunnel Project,"The scope-of-work for this contract called for preparation of a Public Education Plan including 1,200 hours of interpreter’s time, school visits, site visits and lab tours, site handout sheets, traveling slide lectures, popular reports, volunteer programs, teacher training, and outreach to the public schools. A full-scale Interpretive Plan was also to be prepared for the purpose of guiding a second, even more ambitious phase of interpretation: museum exhibits, videos, traveling exhibits, wide distribution of popular reports, and more. The Public Education Plan was implemented in full; the Interpretive Plan was abandoned. The limiting factors turned out to be both organizational and financial. Nevertheless, the public outreach aspect of this project was certainly one of the most ambitious and successful of recent decades."
1998,Katherine Naylor’s “House of office”: A seventeenth-century privy,"In the late 17th century, Katherine Naylor and her children lived in a house fronting on Ann Street in Boston. After the death of her first husband, Robert Nanny, Katherine wed Edward Naylor, who abused her and the children. Subsequently, Edward Naylor ran off with a pregnant household servant, leaving Katherine and the children. Located at the rear of the house lot was the family’s privy, constructed to conform to restrictions placed on the location and configuration of privies in Boston in 1652. The methods used during excavation, the stratigraphie sequence, the artifact analysis, and health and sanitation in late 17th-century Boston are discussed."
1998,A seventeenth-century beetle fauna from colonial Boston,"A rich, diverse assemblage of preserved Coleopteran (beetle) remains was analyzed from the Feature 4 Cross Street Back Lot site in Boston, Massachusetts. This fauna represents the first large analysis of a Colonial site using the technique of archaeoentomology, resulting in the examination of over 2,000 individuals from 22 samples. The remains indicate that a rich composting environment existed in this feature which was composed of human and animal wastes, infested grain products, table wastes, and perhaps floor sweepings. From a biogeographic perspective, this study suggests that many European pest species were already established in New England by the 17th century, substantially altering our knowledge of their introductions."
1998,"Pollen analysis of the feature 4 privy at the Cross Street Back Lot Site, Boston, Massachusetts","The four nightsoil and three episodic fill deposits in the Cross Street site Feature 4 privy vault contained the highest percentages of Eurasian cereal grain-type pollen—wheat (Triticum), barley (Hordeum), oats (Avena), and/or rye (Secale)—reported in any historical archaeological site to date. Comparative pollen data from 8 historical nightsoil deposits, 17 historical house lot and feature profiles, 4 historical commercial/mercantile sites, and 8 profiles from agriculture-associated sites suggest that the Eurasian cereal-type pollen in the Feature 4 privy reflects spoiled flour disposed of in the vault rather than abnormally large quantities of grain products in the diet of the persons utilizing the privy."
1998,Botanical remains from a seventeenth-century privy at the Cross Street Back Lot site,"Botanical remains, including some 250,000 individual seeds and pits, were recovered from the late 17th-century Cross Street Back Lot privy (Feature 4). Analysis of 23 flotation samples taken from 9 contexts has revealed a sequence of events related to the different uses of the privy prior to its final capping. The predominant uncharted floral remains offer a detailed look at the use of native and non-native fruits, nuts, and spices and at the prevalence of weedy or adventive plant species in the urban north end of late 17th-century Boston."
1998,Animal bones from the Cross Street Back Lot privy,"The faunal assemblages from the Central Artery project offer a wonderful opportunity to investigate diet, economic choice, and husbandry in early New England. But finely stratified deposits, such as the Cross Street Back Lot privy, also allow detailed comparisons that provide evidence of variability that can be glossed over when discussing regional subsistence patterns. Some of this variability, and how it can be seen or not seen, is studied using the traditional tools of modern zooarchaeology, and integrated, using the careful controls provided by the stratification, with artifactual and environmental evidence."
1998,Textiles from the seventeenth-century privy at the Cross Street Back Lot site,"A variety of textiles came from the excavation of a 17th-century privy behind the Nanny House site on Cross Street, Boston, Massachusetts. The largest group of fragments is silk fabrics and ribbons, valuable since cloths of this fine fiber have not survived in other 17th-century New England archaeological sites. Comparison of the fine wool textiles from Boston with coarse wool fabrics used by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians in Connecticut and Narragansett Indians in Rhode Island reveal distinct differences in quality. Fabrics made from a combination of silk and wool, cotton, or linen show the variety of mixtures that were available for those who could afford them. Negative pseudomorphs of cotton and bast fibers preserved evidence of cellulosic products in a mineralized form previously unreported in New England. The family that lived at this site used high quality fabrics with expensive weaves, mixtures, and fancy trims representing fashionable 17th-century dress."
1998,Forming the past,"The water-logged components of five shoes from the 17th-century Nanny privy and one shoe and one boot from the 19th-century Mill Pond site were treated, shaped, and reformed as part of the Central Artery Project. Four of the 17th-century shoes have an unusual square gap-toe and may have been made in Boston."
1998,"Wharves, privies, and the pewterer: Two colonial period sites on the Shawmut Peninsula, Boston","During the 18th century, the urbanization of Boston included the development of the low-lying portions of the Shawmut Peninsula. The Paddy’s Alley (BOS-HA-12) and Mill Pond (BOS-HA-14) sites are located on a narrow isthmus connecting Boston’s North End to the rest of the peninsula. Excavations at these sites allowed the examination of a variety of research topics: waterfront modification, sanitation, land use, and commercial activities. At the Paddy’s Alley site, excavations were located at the rear of two residential lots. These areas had been used as a garden and for a workshop. The Mill Pond site was located at the rear of property abutting Mill Pond. Landmaking and wharf construction along the water’s edge, as well as use of the area for a stable, was recorded. Excavation procedures included use of the Harris system of stratigraphie recording that provided detailed stratigraphic control."
1998,Filling Boston’s Mill Pond,"The archaeological investigations conducted by the Central Artery/Tunnel project in the area of Boston’s Mill Pond, a natural cove dammed off in the 17th century and filled in the early 19th, found evidence that land was created in the Mill Pond in the 18th as well as the 19th century. Landmaking in the Mill Pond is examined in the light of these archaeological findings and recent historical research, resulting in some new insights about how the Mill Pond was filled."
1998,"To market, to market: Animal husbandry in New England","This work explores archaeological age data and their ability to identify shifts in animal husbandry that are the direct result of changes that occurred in Boston during the 18th century, when the city’s population was growing and the regions’ market system was evolving into a well-developed market system. Archaeological age data illustrate two important points: first, that households living in urban communities were enmeshed in economic trade systems, and second, that patterns evident in the archaeological record are, to a greater extent than often presumed, the result of large-scale distribution systems rather than variability related to household rank and ethnic affiliation."
1998,Massachusetts bay foodways: Regional and class influences,"Regional foodways in urban and rural settings in Massachusetts Bay and the Chesapeake during the 17th and 18th century are discussed to evaluate their existence and origin. The nature of the differences suggests that their origin had a strong cultural component and came from the initial dominance of “charter” cultures derived from specific regions of England. The cause of these regional cultures was closely tied to the class-based nature of these regions. These differences are expressed in both the exploitation of wild food and in preferences for baking as early as the end of the 17th century, suggesting that regional foodways existed and developed from different foodways baselines in the two regions studied."
1998,The archaeology of frustrated ambition: An Australian case-study,"Questions concerning cultural adaptation are particularly important in Australian historical archaeology because of the distances involved in the European settlement of Australia, and the unfamiliar environment faced by early colonists.. One such question concerns the socioeconomic and political failure of some early colonial land-holders who ran estates based on assigned convict labor. A notable example was Major Archibald Clunes Innes, who during the 1830s and 1840s developed extensive pastoral, agricultural, and commercial interests in what is now northeastern New South Wales. At Lake Innes, near Port Macquarie, on what was then the very edge of colonial settlement, he created an estate from which he could control his various activities, while living in a style that he could never have aspired to in his native Scotland. The remains of his extensive brick-built house and stables, as well as the sites of a range of estate facilities, reflect his ambitions for the future, while the survival of this archaeological evidence largely results from the frustration of those ambitions."
1998,The literature and locations of the phoenix button,"Brass military buttons with the figure of a phoenix bird are reported with great regularity from the West Coast of the United States. In spite of the excellent previous research and published conclusions of Emory Strong, there is a wealth of misinformation still being published. The literature, including both historical data and speculation on the original source of the buttons as well as site reports listing such buttons, is assembled and summarized, essentially an annotated bibliography with locational maps, as an additional step in the analysis of these distinctive artifacts. A bipolar distribution — involving burial caches and body ornamentation on the lower Columbia River and use as buttons in mission sites of California — is suggested, but as yet there is a dearth of research tying the two areas together. New directions for additional research include locating unreported buttons, developing distributional studies, verifying the theories of origins, and determining trading patterns."
1998,Nail chronology: The use of technologically derived features,A technology-based nail chronology is presented. This chronology is derived from a typology based on a combination of general information about the historical developments of the technology applied by the nail manufacturing industry and the periods of actual use for each of twelve basic nail types presently identified as having been used in Louisiana. The author believes that the approach used to establish the Louisiana Nail Chronology can also be used to establish accurate nail chronologies in other regions.
1998,"Thomas Harris, Gent., as related by his second sonne","This paper offers interpretations developed from several years of excavation at the site of Curles Plantation, located on the James River just east of Richmond, Virginia. The “Findings” are presented in a fictionalized form. Life on the frontier of the 17th-century Virginia Colony is depicted through the device of a 1678 petition from William Harris to the governor. Embedded within the petition is a narrative of the life of Harris’s father. In this way a single document is made to cover a variety of subjects about life in this area from the founding of the colony through the aftermath of Bacon’s rebellion of 1676. Following the story is a short essay describing the sources of both information and inspiration used to construct the interpretations."
1998,"“Katherine Nanny, alias Naylor”: A life in puritan Boston","Katherine Wheelwright Nanny Naylor (1630–1716) arrived in Boston with her family in 1636. During the last half of the 17th century, she occupied a property along Ann Street in Boston’s North End. The excavation of that property nearly 300 years later prompted research on Katherine’s life. From the bare bones of vital records, deeds, and probate records, a fascinating life emerged. Katherine raised several families on the Ann Street property, despite outliving most of her children. She was widowed at an early age and remarried. She successfully sued for divorce from her second husband on the grounds of domestic abuse—including an apparent poisoning attempt—and adultery. Ultimately she died at a ripe old age. Her story illuminates the daily lives of Puritan Bostonians."
1998,"Farm Journal: First person, four voices","I weave together evidence archaeological, documentary, pictorial, and imagined to create first-person stories of the men and women who lived at the Spencer-Peirce-Little Farm, Newbury, Massachusetts, ca. 1780–1820. These are the stories of two merchants, Nathaniel Tracy, Esquire, and Captain Offin Boardman, and of their wives, Mary Lee Tracy, “the great beauty of her day,” and Sarah Tappan Boardman, ill and confined to her bed for much of the year. The sources uncover a mosaic of business success and business failure, of fortunes lost and social position scrupulously maintained."
1998,"“Why I continue to live across the tracks from sister sue,” as told by William Monroe","Susan Monroe was a young woman when the Second Battle of Manassas took place on her family farm. Fifty years later she lived alone, never having married, in the house that she, her brother William, and sisters Annie and Maggie inherited from their parents. This is the story of how it came about that William, Annie, and Maggie moved to a house across the tracks from Sue and what Confederate and Yankee veterans of the Battle of Manassas found when they visited Sue’s home to view her shrine to the “Lost Cause” during the 21 July 1911 “Great Peace Jubilee and Reunion of the Blue and Gray.”"
1998,A future after freedom,"Just after the Civil War, two African-American families left Maryland to build new lives in northern Delaware. Sidney and Rachel Stump and David and Sarah Walmsley probably did not know each other in Maryland, but they settled in nearby communities in Delaware. There work, family, church, and community connections may have introduced them. Both men labored on area farms, when they could get work, until they were at least 70 years old. Both women did laundry and sewing for neighbors in town. Both families raised their children to work hard and to value education, their faith, and “joyous play.” The Stumps and Walmsleys drew on their pasts and looked to the future as they created a distinctive cultural style framed by racism and constrained opportunities. Archaeology prompted by the Delaware Department of Transportation’s road-building activities has brought us closer to these families’ stories. In this paper, readers visit them in their homes on the edge of town, as they prepare for a most important event in their annual festive calendar, the Big Quarterly."
1998,Further tales of the vasco,"As the inlet pipe was ceremoniously opened, filling the long awaited reservoir for the very first time, the Vasco Adobe disappeared beneath the waters of the Los Vaqueros Reservoir. Built in the 1850s by a group of rough Basque cattle ranchers, the adobe had been the scene of tragedies, feuds, fights, failures, and betrayals. Its occupants made and lost fortunes for themselves, and for their lawyers. Only when the cascading series of lawsuits was settled was the adobe abandoned and its residents moved into a plain, wooden house. Melted by rain and buried by flood silts, the adobe remarkably survived the ownership of Oscar Starr, inventor of the Caterpillar tractor, who test-drove his bulldozers on the ranch. It also survived the tenure of gun-toting San Francisco socialite and party-girl, Edith Ordway, who buried her toothless pet raccoon next to the old building’s remains. Archaeologists, historians, architects, and folklorists studied the Vasco Adobe so that its stories would not be lost beneath the waters of Los Vaqueros Reservoir."
1998,Bread fresh from the oven: Memories of italian breadbaking in the California Mother Lode,"A chain-migration in the 1860s–1880s brought rural Italian villagers from near Genoa to the southern California Mother Lode. Among other traditions, that of baking bread in outdoor ovens persevered over generations until commercial bread became widely available in the 1930s. An archaeological study of these ovens, begun in 1979, included site excavation, data analysis, detailed measurments, and archival research. Occasional oral interviews also recorded the words, expressions, and feelings of those who remembered the ovens’ use, stories that were not addressed by academic research. These stories told by informants may constitute, ultimately, the more valuable record of this historic oven tradition. Excerpts from five stories are presented as examples of this rich source of information."
1998,Lurid tales and homely stories of New York’s notorious five points,"The rich artifactual data that was recovered on a block in Manhattan, which was once part of the notorious Five Points district, suggests aspects of everyday life among New York’s emerging working class that were previously unavailable. By weaving the artifacts into narrative vignettes that connect the artifacts to their owners, and drawing on secondary sources for historical context, the neighborhood emerges as something quite different than contemporary and even recent sources have portrayed. This paper contrasts previously published “tales” about Five Points with the more homely stories constructed from the artifactual and historical data. The use of narrative is considered here as a way of “knowing” the past as well as presenting it."
1998,A Connecticut merchant in chinadom: A play in one act,"By 1855 four of the five Chinese District Associations in California had offices and boardinghouses in Sacramento on I Street between Fifth and Sixth. Agents of these Chinese Associations nurtured important reciprocal relationships with Sacramento businessmen, including Josiah Gallup, a merchant from Connecticut. Gallup discovered his niche as a translator and middleman for the Chinese merchants of San Francisco and Sacramento. He helped them purchase real estate and supplies, transport miners and prostitutes to the gold fields, and negotiate with City officials. This is the story of Joshua Gallup and how he helped the Chinese get started in Sacramento."
1997,"Gunflint production in the Monti Lessini, Italy","Survey and excavation in the Monti Lessini of northern Italy reveal numerous small-scale gunflint production workshops. The location of these is related to the local geology and land-use practices of the 17th through 19th centuries, as well as regional demographics and political events. The recovered artifacts indicate a distinctive type of debitage was produced which allows discrimination of gunflint refuse from prehistoric materials. The stone used is macroscopically identical to French gunflint material commonly identified in historic sites."
1997,The 17th-century cemetery at St. Mary’s City: Mortuary practices in the Early Chesapeake,"Excavation of plow zone units in and around the 17th-century Catholic Chapel at St. Mary’s City, Maryland, revealed the presence of over 190 grave shafts. Although none of these were excavated, the observable characteristics of these features, such as their orientation, location, and inclusion of rubble in the fill, provide significant insights on the use of the cemetery through time. Grave orientation is suggested as a sensitive indicator of changing land use at the site. The discovery of a number of smaller features, associated with the graves, is evaluated as evidence of wooden grave markers. Detailed analysis of a part of the cemetery is used to suggest the absence of the clergy during an unsettled period in Maryland history."
1997,"Landuse reconstruction at the founding settlement of Las Vegas, Nevada","Integration of artifactual, architectural, historical, geoarchaeological, faunal, macrobotanical, and palynological evidence provides the grounds for a model of the landuse history of Las Vegas, Nevada, from the second quarter of the 19th century until 1905. The integrated model reinforces and elaborates upon landuse changes noted in the historic record, but adds details to support a processual, explanatory, analysis that is not well-evidenced by available documentation. From this perspective, the landuse history of Las Vegas appears always to have been more significantly influenced by socioeconomic factors than ecological conditions—a reality that continues to the present day."
1997,"“This great wild tract”: Henry David Thoreau, Native Americans, and the archaeology of Estabrook Woods","In an 1857 journal entry, Henry David Thoreau described a visit to what he described as a Native American cornfield in Estabrook Woods, a remote portion of Concord, Massachusetts. He noted that the individual hills extended “in straight rows over the swells and valleys ... like the burial ground of some creatures.” Recent archaeological investigations in Estabrook Woods have explored both the cornfield and an adjacent 18th-century farmstead. This paper draws links between landscape change in Concord and larger scale agricultural changes that reshaped the rural communities around Boston. We situate Thoreau’s descriptions of Estabrook Woods in a context of wider 19th-century economic turbulence, as well as his lifelong fascination with Native American culture. The article concludes with reflections on the contemporary conflict between development interests and those who admire Thoreau, and the effect of that conflict on the research agenda."
1997,Secret and sacred: Contextualizing the artifacts of African-American magic and religion,"Although historical archaeologists have accumulated a large amount of data regarding African-American magical and religious systems, researchers still underestimate the importance of magical and religious systems within African-American communities. In addition, archaeologists seem reluctant to interpret these data in a diachronic manner. Spiritual beliefs affected all arenas of the African-American experience including medicine, childcare, gender, family, and community relations. To properly understand African-American daily life, attention must be paid to spiritual traditions. This paper addresses the role of magical practices within African-American society and the importance of recognizing the role of gender ideologies within magical and religious practice, and proposes a diachronic model for understanding the changing relationship between magic and religion. The model, consisting of three stages of cultural change, Formative, Persisting, and Transformative, provides a means of linking the archaeological and documentary databases. Application of the model to three archaeologically well-studied regions demonstrates that, despite growing interest in the archaeological study of African-American spiritual traditions, archaeological evidence for these traditions is sparse when analyzed diachronically."
1997,The search for my African-American Ancestry,"As a genealogist and historian, I approach archaeology as an outsider, as one whose greatest interest in the discipline is in its ability to aid me in my research. From this perspective, I feel I am like many members of the public—I care more about the results of archaeology than about the means and methods it employs to get to those results. This paper describes my collaboration with archaeologists conducting a dig at Wessyngton plantation, the home and workplace of my ancestors before and after Emancipation. Wessyngton plantation, and my ancestors’ lives there, have been the primary subjects of my research since 1976. This paper is in two parts. The first summarizes my research about the African-American people of Wessyngton, describing what I have learned about their identities and lives through my study of genealogy and history. The second part describes my work with the archaeologists and presents my thoughts on what directions archaeologists should take in working with the people who need their help in answering important questions."
1997,"Pre-Emancipation archaeology: Does it play in Selma, Alabama?","This paper is a first-person narrative of one archaeologist’s struggle to achieve public participation in the archaeology of pre-emancipation Alabama. This account details the difficulties of working in a polarized community, famous both for its plantation past and its 20th-century racial strife. Successful participation by local African Americans was only possible after the archaeologist’s academic interest in slavery took a back seat to the needs of the community. Ten years of failures and some successes are summarized. Concluding remarks outline the lessons learned."
1997,Toward “true acts of inclusion”: The “here” and the “out there” concepts in public archaeology,"There is room in public archaeology for “true acts of inclusion” that achieve the creative involvement of diverse audiences in projects. Many historical archaeologists are concerned with social responsibility, representation, and the need to reconcile the “Here ” of archaeology with the “Out There” of public education. The practice of African-American archaeology and dissemination of information about this increasingly important aspect of historical archaeology reveal achievements and unfulfilled potentials of public education in archaeology."
1997,“Power to the people”: Sociopolitics and the archaeology of black Americans,"This article is concerned with the sociopolitics of African-American archaeology. The intent here is to prompt archaeologists to think more about how our research affects black Americans today, and therefore why it is necessary that they be encouraged to take an interest in archaeological endeavors. The success or failure of our attempts to establish ties with black communities depends on us. The main emphases of this article are, therefore, focused on raising our level of awareness to the challenges we face, and increasing understanding as to the variable histories and perspectives that the diverse and knowledgeable black American public possesses and will hopefully share with archaeologists."
1997,Necessary but insufficient: Plantation archaeology reports and community action,"From broken pots, rusted fishhooks, and scraps of bone, archaeologists bring to light aspects of African-American life on antebellum plantations. But it is a dim light, shared by a few through technical reports and scholarly journal articles. This paper examines the distillation of information and ideas from technical reports into publications written specifically for nonarchaeologists. Historical and genealogical society journals, museum newsletters, and church bulletins provide venues through which archaeologists can convey not just what they are doing, but what they have learned. That knowledge has value in the political arena."
1997,“Leveling the playing field” in the contested Territory of the South African past: A “public” versus a “people’s” form of historical archaeology outreach,"In South Africa, the legacy of colonialism and apartheid includes a history of partisan concepts of ethnic and social identity. The long charged, sociopolitical context has also affected research questions, as well as public interpretations, about the past. Today, there are calls for a new past for the new South Africa. Historical archaeology can provide both a methodology and raw materials which South Africans can use to form their own interpretations of their past helping, in turn, to engender pride through a historical consciousness emancipated from colonial and apartheid ideology. This article presents an overview of this complex and changing research context and its implications for a historical archaeology study of South African frontier identity. Research and “public” archaeology efforts concerning material and mythical perspectives of ethnicity are discussed. Employed in a cross-context comparison with African-American research, this study highlights the need for decolonized historical archaeology outreach."
1997,Seizing intellectual power: The dialogue at the New York African Burial Ground,"The New York African Burial Ground Project embodies the problems, concerns, and goals of contemporary African-American and urban archaeology. The project at once has informed and has been informed by the ever-watchful African Americans and New York public. It is a public that understands that the hypothetical and theoretical constructs that guide research are not value-free and are often, in fact, politically charged. An ongoing dialogue between the concerned community, the federal steering committee, the federal government, and the archaeological community has proved difficult but ultimately productive. The project has an Office of Public Education and Interpretation which informs the public through a newsletter, educators’ conferences, and laboratory tours. The public, largely students, attends laboratory tours which often provide initial exposure to archaeology and physical anthropology. Much of this public involvement, however, was driven by angry public reaction to the excavation of a site of both historical prominence and spiritual significance."
1997,Where do we go from here? researching and interpreting the African-American experience,"Museums are striving to improve or incorporate the experiences of African Americans into their interpretations. In doing so, they are challenged to answer questions that relate to issues of historical relevance to the contemporary society, historical ownership, and perspective. Answering these questions requires that consideration be given to the community that is served by the institution, current exhibition, and interpretive trends. Recent scholarship and a steadfast desire to “tell it like it was” are extremely important in a climate where the misinformed often have loud voices. Colonial Williamsburg has had to grapple with these and other issues during the last 15 years as we have helped advance the interpretation of slavery and the early African-American experience at historic sites."
1997,"Descendants, decisions, and power: The Public Interpretation of the archaeology of the levi jordan plantation","Archaeological data from the Levi Jordan plantation in Brazoria County, Texas, indicate that the African Americans who lived on this plantation participated in many activities, several of African origin, that functioned to insure this community’s survival in an increasingly oppressive outside world. Ethnographic data indicate that many descendants of the plantation’s residents, African American and European American, still live in the Brazoria area, and that these descendants continue to negotiate issues of power and control. Any public interpretation of this archaeology will necessarily deal with diverse understandings of race and history in present-day Brazoria County. This paper will describe the political and organizational strategies being employed by a team of descendants, archaeologists, and other community members to plan and implement public interpretations that are “inclusive” of the various histories and archaeologies of the plantation’s ancestors: pre- and post-emancipation African Americans as well as planters."
1997,"Cheers of protest? the public, the Post, and the parable of learning","In 1994, the Washington Post decried the appointment of a white archaeologist to excavate an African-American site in Charlottesville, Virginia. Considerable discussion resulted: in the media, in the Smithsonian’s African American Archaeology Newsletter, and at conferences. Charlottesville held a similar debate between the public and the academy. What story was to be told? Who would tell the story? Would it get told at all? Both debates are embedded in historic and modern relationships of race and class. By the nature of our work, many historical archaeologists are forced to enter these debates or walk away from them. These issues, then become fundamental to involving and exciting the public about what we do. This paper explores the nature of the Charlottesville debate, suggesting that archaeology can be a meaningful form of activism, provided that it yields to the needs of the public it hopes to engage."
1997,Response to a market: Dating english underglaze transfer-printed wares,"At the end of the 18th century, the Staffordshire pottery industry began transfer printing designs on refined earthenwares. Gaining immediate acceptance from both the British and American markets, printed earthenwares remained immensely popular until the mid-19th century. Hundreds of printed patterns were produced, and these patterns formed distinctive decorative styles based on central motifs and borders. Using characteristics of datable, marked vessels as a database, this study establishes a chronology for dating printed earthenwares based on decorative styles and color."
1997,Tombs and testaments: Mortuary practices during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries in the spanish-venezuelan catholic tradition,"The paper synthesizes data obtained from the excavation and observation of several western Venezuelan cemeteries of the 17th to 19th centuries, with documentary information obtained from testaments and other written sources of the same period on the Spanish Catholic funerary ritual. The combination of these two lines of evidence has permitted a preliminary reconstruction of the characteristics of the Venezuelan colonial burial practices, and some of the changes that occurred through time."
1997,"Class, gender, and the built environment: Deriving social relations from cultural landscapes in Southwest Michigan","The houses, barns, and gardens that comprise cultural landscapes embody information about their makers because the built environment actively serves to create, reproduce, and transform social relations. Members of society use space to reinforce and resist relations of power, authority, and inequality by organizing the landscape to facilitate the activities and movements of some individuals, while concurrently constraining others. Historical investigations indicate that the occupants of the village of Plainwell, Michigan, have witnessed political, economic, and social changes at the local, regional, and national levels since the mid-19th century. Yet, archaeological investigation of the Woodhams site (20AE852)—a residential homelot in Plainwell—provides evidence for considerable continuity in class and gender relations, despite transformations in American society at these multiple scales of analysis."
1997,Material culture and African-American spirituality at the hermitage,"In this article, artifacts excavated from 19th-century African-American contexts at the Hermitage plantation near Nashville, Tennessee, are examined in light of their possible use in religious ritual, traditional healing, and other behaviors related to spirituality. While specific spiritual behaviors cannot be determined from the Hermitage archaeological and documentary record, the presence of a distinct African-American belief system at the Hermitage is suggested through comparison of selected artifacts from the Hermitage assemblage with various historical, folkloric, and archaeological sources. This belief system and its associated behaviors may have aided African Americans in achieving limited social and economic autonomy within the system of plantation slavery."
1997,"The archaeology of maroon societies in the Americas: Resistance, cultural continuity, and transformation in the African Diaspora","Archaeology has been initiated in Maroon sites in various parts of the African Diaspora in the Americas. Data from Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Florida, and North Carolina were surveyed in order to examine the directions that studies of Maroon societies have taken. An assessment is in order so that future studies can be planned with cognizance of the problems and possibilities that current research has uncovered. Approaches, theories, and archaeological evidence are analyzed and critiqued, and placed within the context of African Diaspora archaeology. The archaeology of Maroon sites is a rich and virtually untapped area of study. The archaeological study of Maroon sites will advance our knowledge of Africans in the Americas by fostering new perspectives on traditional concepts such as ethnicity, resistance, cultural contact, and culture continuity and change."
1997,Settlement patterning on the British Caribbean Island of Tobago,"Sugar planters on Tobago faced a variety of challenges. Foremost among these were creating and maintaining the economic viability of their estates while subjugating a vastly larger enslaved population. As a minority cultural group, however, planters were also faced with the task of reaffirming their own identities as British subjects. These goals were met by constructing a landscape that offered communications, familiarity, and symbolic power. Sugar estate layouts can be interpreted functionally by focusing on the issues of sugar production and control of an enslaved labor force. This paper adds a third dimension by examining the production of sugar and the control of labor from the perspective of the estate house and its relationship to the larger landscape. Additional hypotheses that could account for settlement choices are presented where production and control are insufficient explanation for patterned arrangements."
1996,The influence of trade on Bahamian slave culture,"The Bahamian plantations of Wade’s Green and Promised Land are compared using analyses of ceramics, tobacco pipes, and beads. The differences in the distributions revealed are explained by each plantation’s market access. The research is significant because it illustrates conditions where economic models commonly used to interpret archaeological data are mediated by local conditions. Distance and isolation from the point of distribution restricted access to goods and accentuated the planter’s control over the goods available to the slaves in the Bahamas."
1996,Mission-period settlement structure: A test of the model at san martín de Timucua,"Beginning in 1968, the Florida Division of Historical Resources sponsored several small-scale testing programs of Spanish mission sites in northern Florida. A formal model of Mission-period settlement structure emerged from those excavations. However, more recent excavations involving large block exposures at a few mission compounds have shown settlement structure to be more complex, and less regular, than modeled. Such is the case at San Martín de Timucua. Recent excavations there have demonstrated that the imposition of the preexisting model on results from previous limited excavations has resulted in misinterpretations of structure architecture and function as well as site layout. These results demonstrate that long-term commitments to extensive excavations will be necessary to understand intrasite settlement patterns in Florida missions."
1996,Shopping as meaningful action: Toward a redefinition of consumption in historical archaeology,"Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The “consumer choice” school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the “qualitative” or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object."
1996,"The Texas Historical Commission’s underwater archaeological survey of 1995 and the preliminary report on the Belle, La Salle’s shipwreck of 1686","The Texas Historical Commission’s underwater archaeology project of 1995 was intended to locate historic shipwrecks and other underwater archaeological sites. The project succeeded in the investigation of several sites in the Matagorda Bay, Texas, area. The sites included wrecks on the Gulf beach of Matagorda Island, lighthouse sites, wharf areas of the historic port of Indianola, and ships associated with World War II. The most important discovery was the remains of the Belle (41MG86), a ship of the French explorer La Salle wrecked in 1686 during his unsuccessful attempt to found a colony on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The site consists of the lower hull of the ship and many in-situ artifacts. Preservation of organic materials was exceptional."
1996,"Compositional constraints on the identification of Eighteenth-Century porcelain sherds from fort Beauséjour, New Brunswick, and Grassy Island, Nova Scotia, Canada","Seven samples of 18th-century British soft-paste porcelain from Fort Beauséjour and Grassy Island were analyzed by microchemical techniques. Four of the samples have Mg+Pb-rich compositions; three are phosphatic. Two of the Mg+Pb-rich samples are attributed to the Dr. Wall period (ca. 1751–1776) of the Worcester manufactory. The other two, however, contain diopside, a mineral not known to occur in Worcester porcelain. One of the phosphatic samples contains sulphate, and compositionally resembles Bow porcelain; two sulphate-free phosphatic samples remain unattributed. Compositional constraints on the origin of these sherds has allowed for a tighter research focus, leading to pattern identification and more precise dating. Three of the Mg+Pb-rich sherds—including one diopside-bearing sample—apparently display the “cannonball” pattern used at Worcester between ca. 1756 and 1785. This feature, together with the Dr. Wall period attribution of the diopside-free samples, brackets their production to ca. 1756–1776. The diopside-bearing sherds likely were made by one of Worcester’s imitators, perhaps Caughley. The decoration on the Bow sherd suggests an early 1760s date. Where undisturbed, there is good correlation between archaeological context and the dated sherds."
1996,"Status and adobe quality at Fort Fillmore, New Mexico: Old questions, new techniques","Adobe and soil samples from Fort Fillmore (1851–1862), New Mexico, were subjected to various laboratory tests in order to evaluate the nature of adobe decay. Samples were collected from the Officers’ Quarters and the Enlisted Men’s Barracks, so that adobe quality at these two distinctive areas—once housing two distinctive groups of soldiers—could be estimated. Test results provided measures of various agents and processes of adobe decay, such as structural failure or chemical and water activities, and suggested that most of the adobe decay at Fort Fillmore has been due to imperfections in the manufacturing process. Adobe for the Officers’ Quarters was better made than adobe for the barracks. Some tentative explanations for this difference in quality are discussed, including the possibility that it was the result of a symbolic expression of status distinctions."
1996,Iberian foodways in the Moquegua and Torata Valleys of Southern Peru,"Spanish settlement of the southern Peruvian coastal river valleys and the introduction of new agricultural and industrial enterprises such as wineries and livestock haciendas altered indigenous systems of production and subsistence. A unique pattern of Spanish colonial animal use emerged as a result of introductions of Old World domesticates in combination with the faunal resources of the Central Andes. Zooarchaeological data from four Spanish colonial wineries from the Moquegua valley and the late prehistoric/colonial site of Torata Alta indicate that colonial economy and subsistence combined Old World domestic mammals and South American camelids—llamas, alpacas. In comparison to Spanish settlement in Florida and the Caribbean, the pattern of animal use that developed in the south Central Andes reflects little reliance on local resources. Colonial Andean foodways more closely parallel those of the Iberian peninsula than other areas of Spanish settlement."
1996,Blue beads as African-American cultural symbols,"Blue beads are consistent finds at African-American sites. Archaeologists acknowledge these artifacts were used for adornment, yet some researchers also propose beads possessed additional cultural meaning among African Americans. For this study bead data from African-American sites in the South are analyzed. The results indicate blue is the predominant bead color. The prevalence of these items suggests they may indeed have been an important yet unrecognized aspect of African-American culture. The multiple underlying meanings assigned to blue beads are considered through reference to ethnographic information, folklore, and oral history associated with West and Central Africa and the Southeast."
1996,"A prone burial from a plantation slave cemetery in Barbados, West Indies: Possible evidence for an African-type witch or other negatively viewed person","Dating to the late 1600s or early 1700s, a burial excavated from a slave cemetery at Newton Plantation in Barbados had several unique characteristics. Buried in the largest artificial earthen mound in the cemetery without grave goods or a coffin, this young adult woman was the solitary interment in the mound and the cemetery’s only prone burial. Her skeleton showed no signs of unusual death although analysis of lead in her bones suggests she suffered from severe lead poisoning. Documentary evidence on Barbados slave culture in general and ethnographic/ethnohistorical evidence on West African mortuary practices suggest interpretations for this burial: She may have been a witch or some other negatively viewed person with supernatural powers who, following African custom, was feared or socially ostracized."
1996,The site of the intendant’s palace in Québec City: The changing meaning of an urban space,"The site of the Intendant’s Palace, which was excavated by the Laval University field school between 1982 and 1990, has been occupied numerous times from 1668 to the present. A brewery, the Intendant’s Palace, the King’s Stores and prisons, residential housing, a bakery, another brewery, a city park, and, finally, an archaeological interpretive site all have stood here at some point. This synthesis is based largely on the research contributions of archaeologists, historians, and ethnologists. These prior reports on the site make it possible not only to reconstruct the way in which the site developed through successive phases of composition and decomposition, but also to determine the various meanings acquired by the site as it has undergone structural changes and its relationship to its immediate and more remote contexts."
1996,"Archaeogeophysical and geochemical studies at George Washington Carver National Monument, Diamond, Missouri","Geophysical and geochemical prospection studies were carried out at George Washington Carver National Monument in the mid- to late 1970s. Together with a reanalysis of materials excavated by P. L. Beaubien in the 1950s, a reasonable historical and archaeological picture of Dr. Carver’s birthplace and family dwellings has been developed. Revisiting the geophysical data in the 1990s prompted this synthesis of the various studies by this author. The results will be seen as informative of the methodology of archaeological geophysics as well as to midwestern historical archaeology."
1996,Continuity and change: De Soto and the Apalachee,"The expedition of Hernando de Soto has been touted as one of the primary factors of the demise of the native societies in the Southeast. European steel and infectious disease were the reputed agents of their destruction. While the de Soto entrada battled many of the native polities it encountered, recent studies suggest that the consequences were less disruptive in some places than previously thought. Indeed, changes were already in progress when the Europeans arrived. Evidence from the excavation of the Governor Martin site in northern Florida indicates that the Apalachee who received Franciscan missionaries in the 17th century were little different from those encountered by de Soto in 1540. The impact of European diseases on the native cultures was clearly significant; however, it would be imprudent to invoke monocausal explanations without exploring other factors that could have contributed to the social and demographic changes experienced by these societies."
1996,The landscapes of northern bondage,"In his 1988 book, Black Yankees, William Piersen argued that quartering slaves within their owners’ homes led to a mild and paternalistic form of slavery in New England. This article challenges this position by arguing that in Narragansett, Rhode Island, shared domestic space was an important aspect of slave control. Quartering slaves within the main house allowed planters to monitor their actions and led to a form of racial segregation at meals, church, and in burials designed to mark slaves as aliens and teach them “their place.” Slaves responded by circumventing monitored space and turning segregated space to their advantage by using this unsupervised time to socialize among themselves. This conflict between the masters’ desire to monitor their bondsmen—the term used in historical accounts and documents— and the slaves’ attempts to escape this surveillance typified Narragansett master/slave relations. In this manner, slavery in Narragansett, Rhode Island, was strikingly similar to southern slavery."
1996,"Yesterday, today, and tomorrow: A plea for change in the practice of historical archaeology","Historical archaeology, since its very beginnings, has been shaped more by the manner in which research is funded than by the intellects of its practitioners. Prevailing research and management approaches today are examined critically and argued to be maladaptive for continued growth and evolution of the discipline in the future."
1996,Theorizing the management of archaeology underwater,"This paper summarizes the construction of a conceptual framework that can explain, rather than merely describe, the management of archaeology underwater. The four principal concepts—Context, Value, Function, and Form—address the interrelationship between the following influences on the conduct of management: practical and cognitive circumstances; archaeological and nonarchaeological values; the provisions through which these values are operationalized; and the influence of institutions. The framework has been developed over the course of detailed comparative analysis of the management of archaeology underwater in northwest Europe, and is applied to analysis of the dynamics of management in the United Kingdom (U.K.)."
1996,"Archaeological examination of Fort Reliance, Yukon","Fort Reliance was an American trading post, located 11 km below the mouth of the Klondike River, Yukon Territory. Founded as a small fur-trading post, Fort Reliance later served the first prospectors in the region. The Canadian Museum of Civilization tested the site in 1983 and 1991 to assess the nature and extent of archaeological remains, and to determine the relationship between native use of the site and the trading post. The results show that there was native occupation of the site prior to the duration of Fort Reliance. Artifacts of more recent European and native origin were found on structure floors and in soil layers and feature pits located outside the structures."
1996,Analyzing musket balls to interpret a revolutionary war site,"During a Sunday outing in 1992, the Deep Search Metal Detecting Club collected a small number of Revolutionary War musket balls at a county park in New Jersey. Two areas of artifact concentration were generally recorded and park officials were notified. In 1993 the Monmouth County Park System had the same areas plowed to remove vegetation and a limited Phase I archaeological survey was conducted. Additional musket balls were excavated under more controlled conditions. New Jersey is known as the “Crossroads of the Revolution,” and finds of this type are not unusual. A detailed analysis of the ordnance shows the vast majority of balls are 0.68–0.70 in. in diameter and exhibited no evidence of being fired. The size and surface characteristics indicate the musket balls were probably military and possibly British. The interpreted data indicate that this site was a resting place and only used for a very short period of time, possibly only overnight."
1995,Terrible saint: Changing meanings of the John Brown Fort,"Interpretations of national icons, including John Brown, often present themselves as timeless, rather than as the last link in a long chain of historical revisionisms. From generation to generation and from region to region, interpretations of John Brown have differed. This analysis demonstrates that the engine house, occupied by Brown and his followers during his attempted capture of Harpers Ferry, is an unstable sociocultural symbol among the white community, while it has been a stable icon among the black community. Its meaning and locations changed as the social and political atmosphere changed in this country."
1995,Three ironclad warships—The archaeology of industrial process and historical myth,"Three ironclad warships, C.S.S.Georgia, U.S.S.Cairo, and U.S.S.Monitor, are discussed as examples of industrial process in the United States Civil War period. In their archaeological study the author and others have relied principally on explanatory methodologies that stress their definition within social and technological contexts. This explanatory protocol is examined within concepts of technology which involve the function, and functioning, of manufactured things both within their own era as well as in present-day life. This consideration examines the mythologization of historic things, particularly shipwrecks, and cites the need to identify and account for this occurrence within the archaeological and historical analysis of these or any other industrial sites."
1995,Material culture and social death: African-American burial practices,"Orlando Patterson has proposed that the institution of slavery caused the “social death” of slaves, in that the inherited meanings of their ancestors were denied to them through control of their cultural practices by slave owners and overseers. A survey of archaeological evidence for mortuary practices in African-American society, however, shows that this was not the case, as such inherited meanings were present throughout the early historical period, and in some communities are still present. The careful identification of such occurrences can only be made through comparison to African archaeological and ethnographic evidence. Such occurrences do not negate the horrors of the dominance of slaveholders over slaves in the New World, but do give an opportunity to celebrate the unique nature of African-Atlantic culture."
1995,"The importance of the community study approach in historical archaeology, with an example from late colonial St. Augustine","The community study has been one of the most productive but least used approaches to the archaeological study of the past. This situation is especially ironic because community study offers a framework which overcomes many of the problems and fulfills most of the goals of contemporary historical archaeology. It is based in the relationship of people and locale, it is conducive to the synthesis of documentary and archaeological data, it can be used in conjunction with hypothesis testing, and it employs a comparative approach which deals with groups of sites and multiple classes of data. This article reviews the development of community study in sociology, anthropology, and historical archaeology; defines its methods as employed by major practitioners; and shows how the community study approach was applied to the study of ethnicity and class in late colonial St. Augustine."
1995,The Padre Island crossbows,"This article presents a detailed study of crossbows recovered from the shipwrecks of Padre Island, Texas, dating to 1554. Traditional archaeological and historical analysis is enhanced by production of working replicas of the light Spanish-style crossbows. A possible maritime adaptation of the weapon is identified."
1995,The case of the missing victuals,"The evidence for birds and mammals recovered from excavations at the former Royal Navy Victualling Yard opposite the Tower Hill in London and a new method of combining all the stratigraphic and environmental evidence shed new light on several aspects of 17th- to 18th-century life: the contrasts and connections between feasting in the officers’ quarters and tanning in the tenements, fish and the Spanish Armada, unscrupulous milkmaids and swindling cattle dealers, Dutch furniture and snail pie. A new method is presented for using fragmentary cattle horn cores as corroborative dating evidence, and investigations are conducted into the mysterious fate of the “missing victuals.”"
1995,"Differential pollen preservation in a seventeenth-century refuse pit, Jamestown Island, Virginia","Pollen that falls on soil surfaces is moved down through the deposit by percolating groundwater. As it moves, the pollen is progressively destroyed by oxygen in the groundwater and by aerobic fungi. In the Chesapeake Bay region, the deepest pollen in unsheltered archaeological site profiles is about 100 years old. A comparative study of a stratigraphic pollen profile exposed to the elements at the surface and a series of pollen samples sheltered by artifacts was conducted with materials from a 17th-century refuse pit at Jamestown, Virginia. Pollen was recovered both from under rocks and artifacts lying flat or concave side down and from around iron objects. The shallowest pollen spectrum recovered from under an artifact was 25 cm below the deepest pollen preserved in the exposed stratigraphic profile. No pollen was found in unsheltered pollen samples at the same depths as the artifacts. The distributions demonstrate that the pollen associated with the 17th-century artifacts is contemporaneous with those artifacts; it did not percolate down from later deposits. The artifact pollen spectra were arranged by depth into an artificial profile and appear to record a series of edaphic changes in the pit and a landclearance episode in the Jamestown area."
1995,Health care and the wayman A.M.E. church,"Research conducted at the Wayman African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church in Bloomington, Illinois, underscores the multifaceted role of the black church. Although the Wayman A.M.E. Church served as a religious center, medical artifacts from excavation suggest the church as an institution provided health care to segments of the congregation and local community during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Historical information in combination with archaeological data illustrate a dual health care strategy was practiced by the congregation. This dual strategy was based on the use of both traditional, or folk, healing practices and formal medical care. More importantly, the health care artifacts highlight the inequality that blacks have experienced in obtaining adequate medical care. Corresponding temporally to a series of epidemics in Bloomington, the health care artifacts suggest the church congregation did not passively accept the inequality characteristic of the period."
1995,"Recognizing children’s graves in nineteenth-century cemeteries: Excavations in St. Thomas Anglican Churchyard, Belleville, Ontario, Canada","Graves from personally identified individuals from St. Thomas Anglican Churchyard, dated 1821–1874, were examined for features that differentiate children’s graves from those of adults. The study was facilitated by the presence of identifiable skeletal remains, abundant coffin artifacts including coffin plates that identified those interred, and associated historical records. The purpose was to evaluate whether or not there was a distinctive pattern in the archaeological record that could be used as a model for recognizing children’s graves in the absence of historical records or skeletal remains. Coffin length, number of coffin handles, coffin handle motif, and coffin handle size were found to distinguish children’s and adults’ graves. The presence of plain or decorated coffin handles, coffin plates, or glass viewing plates was not associated with age at death. Comparisons with other cemeteries and hardware catalogs indicate that the pattern is widespread geographically. Mortuary symbols of purity, innocence, and nature identify children with the home and heaven, in contrast to the workplace of men, spheres that were increasingly separated with industrialization, urbanization, and material progress in the 19th century."
1995,"The historical archaeology of Vergelegen, an early Farmstead at the Cape of Good Hope","Excavations at Vergelegen, a large estate in the Western Cape of South Africa that dates to the earliest years of the 18th century, have allowed archaeologists to address a number of questions about the nature of colonial settlement in this former Dutch colony. Primary among these were questions about slavery and about the interrelationships between slaves, colonists, and the indigenous inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope. This article offers some of the results of this investigation, and an interpretation of those results in light of the original questions about slave community, slave-indigenous interaction, and early colonial architecture in the Cape."
1995,"Recovering the lost landscapes of the Stockton Gardens at Morven, Princeton, New Jersey","A variety of field techniques for the recovery of buried landscapes has been successfully and unsuccessfully used in the Midatlantic. Using examples from Morven, the utility of several are surveyed here. Of particular service was the practice of recording elevations as feet (ft.) above-sea-level readings; it permitted planned variations in garden contours (i.e., terraces, falls, sunken groves, drainage grading) to be observed across wide areas of the site. The system of measurement used in the 18th century, based on Renaissance surveying techniques, and knowledge of its use in designing gardens, enables modern archaeologists to predict where key elements of older landscapes may be found below ground. Other methods discussed include the use of the split spoon auger, the steel T-probe, post hole digger, backhoe trenching, checkerboard excavation, and areal excavation. While none is particularly unique or innovative, using them in combination provides the archaeologist with powerful tools for interpretation of buried historic landscapes."
1995,"Women and property in early 19th-century Portsmouth, New Hampshire","In the early 19th century the Deer Street neighborhood of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, enjoyed considerable social stability. This article builds a precise historical framework for the interpretation of archaeological remains associated with this time period. The Deer Street archaeological projects uncovered both sites and features closely associated with Portsmouth women and dated between the years 1820 and 1840. The relationship between the women of the neighborhood and their property, both real and personal, provides the focus for the discussion of the historical and archaeological record."
1995,Contexts of meaning: Beer bottles and cans in contemporary burial practices in the Polynesian kingdom of Tonga,"Interpretations of symbolic meaning and nonverbal communication have gained a strong foothold in the field of historical archaeology as post-processual theory becomes more widely accepted. Through an examination of beer bottles and beer cans used as components of grave decoration in the Polynesian kingdom of Tonga, the potential pitfalls of this approach can be illustrated. In “recovering mind,” care must be taken to ensure cause, motivations, and rationalizations are not solely a product of one’s own cultural milieu."
1995,"Thimbles and thimble rings from the circum-Caribbean region, 1500–1800: Chronology and identification","This paper provides an overview of literature on the subject of thimbles. Particular attention is devoted to the identification of functional categories and determining the gender and age composition of a site using thimbles. Major innovations in construction, decorative patterning, and shape are identified as well. Archaeologically, thimbles are often recovered at European domestic sites, in aboriginal burials, and as trade goods. This omnipresent artifact has considerable potential for general dating and demographic purposes."
1994,Interdisciplinary approaches to the meanings and uses of material goods in Lower Town Harpers Ferry,"Recent archaeological excavations performed by the National Park Service at Harpers Ferry have contributed significantly toward understanding domestic life during both the 19th-century armory period and subsequent commercial development of the town. Many studies have focused on technical industrial development of cities, although few studies have highlighted the effects of industrialization on everyday life. An interdisciplinary approach provides insight into issues related to health, hygiene, diet, consumer behavior, landscape, and gender relations."
1994,Social dynamics and structure in Lower Town Harpers Ferry,"From a small transportation crossroads at the confluence of two major rivers, Harpers Ferry grew into a thriving 19th-century industrial and commercial establishment. A federal armory manufactured guns here from the turn of the 19th century until its destruction during the Civil War. During this period, the master armorer occupied Block B, the focus of this study, in Lower Town Harpers Ferry. After the war, Block B became part of the commercial center of the town, as well as home for leading entrepreneurial families and transient boarders."
1994,Changing social and material routine in Nineteenth-Century Harpers Ferry,"The transition from an agrarian to an industrial society was accepted at different rates among 19th-century Harpers Ferry residents and workers. Incorporating or excluding the segmenting principles of industrialization into domestic life created dramatic changes in the domestic lives of armory workers. Domestic archaeological assemblages are compared for two master armorers: one who supported the earlier task-oriented system of production, and the other who attempted to change the armory into a more systematic and modern industrialized facility. Distinctive differences between the assemblages appear and are attributed to changing perceptions of industrialism."
1994,Floral history by the back door: A test of phytolith analysis in residential yards at Harpers Ferry,"Phytolith analysis was used to reconstruct two centuries of floral history for the yards of two structures at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia: the first master armorer’s residence and an armory worker’s house. The decay-in-place tendency of phytolith deposition provided insight into both general conditions of floral assemblages and specific floristic patterns in the adjacent lots of the respective residences. Contrasts between prehistoric flora and that resulting from impact of European arrival was evident in the phytolith record. Phytolith analysis also revealed specific aspects of landscaping—or the lack of it—as effected by the sequence of occupants in the houses."
1994,The health and sanitation of postbellum Harpers Ferry,"This paper examines the documentary and archaeological evidence for health reform in 19th-century postbellum Harpers Ferry. The analysis reviews the cultural logic embodied in the national health reform ideals, a late 19th-century social movement aimed at abolishing unhealthy living conditions. The model that guides this analysis is based on the premise that cultural categories and principles cannot be viewed as normative sociocultural systems regulating human action. As a result, social action and therefore cultural interpretation must be seen as an active and contested discourse. The diverse interpretations of the national ideals of health reform as suggested by the documentary and material evidence for Harpers Ferry are explained as conscious decisions framed in particular social, economic, and political contexts."
1994,"Sanitation and parasitism at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia","One focus of historical archaeology at Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, West Virginia, is tracing the development of sanitation at the town through the 1800s and 1900s. Historical documentation indicates that there was a degree of resistance to the modernization of village sanitation. This study attempts to verify this resistance through examination of privy soils for parasites indicative of fecal-borne disease, specifically the helminth species Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura. The presence of these parasites in the early 1900s would indicate that fecal-borne disease due to poor sanitation continued to be an aspect of town life. The analysis revealed the eggs of both species in all three privies, indicating that resistance to modern sanitation resulted in the maintenance of fecal-borne disease."
1994,A boardinghouse madonna—Beyond the aesthetics of a portrait created through medicine bottles,"Medicine bottles, examined within a larger context, provide an opportunity to explore how material culture influences, reinforces, and reflects late 19th-century gender roles. Bottles from one of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park’s late 19th-century privies reflect the gender role of a mother. Available information limits this paper to the examination of a 19th-century ideal. Examining the ideal through both archaeological and documentary evidence, however, reveals the apparatus of ideology and the effects of the ideal in practice. A mutual relationship between genders becomes apparent as does the need to maintain the interrelatedness of gender with other structuring principles of culture."
1994,"A la Russe, à la Pell-Mell, or à la Practical: Ideology and compromise at the late Nineteenth-Century dinner table","This article examines the material forms that graced late 19th-century dinner tables and surveys the various styles of dining that flourished during this period. Ceramic and glass dining items available during the 1880s and 1890s, and their associated practices, reveal broader societal mechanisms at work than merely supply and demand. How these materials and practices were incorporated into everyday context-specific social strategies is the primary concern of this article. Ceramic and glass data from two archaeological investigations of a boardinghouse and the residence of a wealthy and influential family, both dating to the end of the 19th century in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, will be used as a model for this inquiry."
1994,"Diet and prehistoric landscape during the Nineteenth and early Twentieth centuries at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia: A View from the old master armorer’s complex","Examination of pollen and macrofloral remains from possible garden and yard areas yielded evidence for a variety of weedy plants, such as buffalo bur, crab-grass, clover, purslane, mustard family, and nut-grass. The makeup of the forest during the early historic period was similar to that in the prehistoric, although evidence indicates that the forest was apparently thinned during the 1800s."
1994,"There’s trouble a-Brewin’: The brewing and bottling industries at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia","During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a brewery and bottling plant operated in the town of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Archaeological excavations recovered beer and soft drink bottles once used by these industries. Considering that the brewery was operational in Harpers Ferry for over 10 years and bottled soft drinks and beer, it was surprising that relatively few bottles attributable to the brewery were recovered from the excavations. In order to understand this phenomenon, this study examines the historical context of the brewery, its associated bottling plant, and the people who worked in these industries. The Harpers Ferry brewery bottles recovered from the excavations are described and compared with bottles from regional breweries and bottling plants. Various possibilities for the lack of bottles are considered, including financial problems of the brewery, popularity of the product, and temperance."
1994,"Inclusion and exclusion in the Moravian settlement in North Carolina, 1770–1790","The study of the late 18th-century Moravian community in Salem, North Carolina, provides an excellent opportunity to illustrate the value in looking beyond “boundedness” in historical archaeological research. Rather than viewing Salem as an isolated and homogenous community, this article focuses on the ways in which the leaders of this community struggled with conflicting needs. The Moravian leadership needed to balance the maintenance of group cohesion and internal social control with a need to appear as part of the larger Anglo-American world around them. How the Moravians confronted and mediated these conflicting needs is examined through the use of documentary information, the built environment, and archaeological material."
1994,Contact and contagion: The Roanoke colony and influenza,"A comparison of the writings of Thomas Hariot, leader of the ill-fated Roanoke colony, and John Smith, founder of the first successful British settlement in North America, reveals that the Roanoke colonists were the vectors of epidemic disease. The disease was probably influenza, and it was especially lethal to the American Indians whom the Roanoke colonists contacted. Thomas Hariot recorded direct observations of the progress of the epidemic, including symptoms, mode of transmission, and virulence. John Smith, upon his arrival in the Chesapeake Bay region, heard stories of a devastating epidemic that had ravaged the Accomac, one of the groups visited by the Roanoke colonists during the winter of 1585/86. This article critically assesses the historical evidence surrounding this epidemic and proposes influenza as the probable pathogen. Depopulation of American Indians in the vicinity of the Roanoke colony, specifically the Accomac, is placed within the wider context of European epidemic disease in the New World. One implication of this historical record is the identification of Virginia’s Eastern Shore as an area likely to contain archaeological resources relevant to the research problem of American Indian demographic change during the Contact period."
1994,Towards an anthropological historical archaeology in Greece,"During the past three decades, various techniques and theoretical approaches developed by anthropological archaeologists have made steady inroads into the study of Greek prehistory. Most Aegean prehistorians are now conversant with survey methods, absolute chronometric techniques, ecological models, and the issues raised by the New Archaeology. Scholars who deal with historical periods (Archaic through Early Modern, i.e., 8th century b.c. to 15th century a.d.), however, have, with a few notable exceptions, been slower to adopt such innovations. For example, Late Roman and Byzantine archaeologists infrequently discuss issues of local subsistence, settlement hierarchies based on survey data, and theoretical models of social change. Chronologically, Aegean archaeologists largely ignore the period between the 16th and 20th centuries. This article reviews a series of recent efforts that attempt to introduce such theoretical and methodological approaches to historical archaeology in Greece. Among these developments are nonsite survey, geophysical prospecting, the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for predictive modeling, and the application of various theoretical approaches as explanatory frameworks. This paper provides an historical overview of the forces that led historical archaeology along different paths in North America and Greece, respectively, points out recent trends that signal a convergence, and presents examples of such research from various projects in Greece."
1994,"Mortuary patterns at the Harney site slave cemetery, Montserrat, in Caribbean perspective","Mortuary patterns discernible at the Harney site, despite its disturbed condition, include demographic, burial, and artifact information derived from 17 skeletons, 19 unmatched bones, 10 graves, and 134 artifacts. The cemetery dates to the late 18th century and provides data on the mortuary practices of enslaved persons in Montserrat at a time when sugar production dominated the economy of the British West Indies. A broader perspective on the mortuary patterns of enslaved populations within the Caribbean region is provided by comparable data from burial sites in two other British islands, Barbados and Jamaica, and a mainland South American colony, Dutch Guiana—now Suriname. Collaboration by avocational and professional archaeologists during the Harney site salvage project exemplifies the joint research efforts typical of many small islands in the eastern Caribbean."
1994,Viewing the color line through the material culture of death,"Historical archaeologists have recently begun to explore the intersections of race, class, gender, and death in American society. This paper uses an approach to the material culture of death grounded in the reception theory of Wolfgang Iser (1978). Grave markers from the African-American cemetery at Newport, Rhode Island, are considered as intersubjective texts with ranges of different meanings for different viewers. Understanding the ranges of possible meanings is crucial for determining the extent to which the color line dividing African Americans and Euroamericans has been set, negotiated, and reset through time and space. The reception theory framework is used to interpret three time periods in Newport’s history ranging from 1720 to 1830; interpretations of textual similarities and differences in cross-cultural mortuary activities revolve around white paternalism, conspicuous consumption, and African-American strategies of resistance and assimilation."
1994,"Search for the grave of the hanged Texas gunfighter, William Preston Longley","The hanging and burial of the notorious Texas gunman William Longley in Giddings, Texas, in 1878 has been believed by some to be a hoax, and it has been rumored that Longley may have lived for 43 more years in Louisiana. Evidence including comparisons of handwriting and computer-based photographs of the individual suspected of being Longley support this belief and suggest that a rock-filled or weighted coffin was buried in place of the body after a forged hanging. One test of the hoax hypothesis would be to find the grave and expose the remains. While it is known that the Longley grave is within the Giddings cemetery, owned by the city of Giddings and designated 41LE132, its exact location is unknown. In an attempt to find the grave, resistivity and magnetometer surveys were performed in areas where historical research indicated the Longley grave might be found. Anomalies were probed and cored, leading to the identification of areas for excavation. Several transects were scraped, using a backhoe, to test the geophysical results. Scraping was also performed in other areas suspected to contain the grave. The unique combination of these methods resulted in the discovery of 34 unmarked burial shafts, 21 of which were excavated. Even though the site is not ideal for remote sensing applications, the results still demonstrate that the methods employed are effective in pinpointing graves. Problems included high clay concentrations in the soil, a multitude of modern burials distributed throughout the search area, and a half meter of fill over part of the site. Unfortunately, researchers were unsuccessful in locating unambiguous evidence of Longley’s grave, leaving his story one of the unsolved mysteries of the Old West."
1994,Determining African birth from skeletal remains: A note on tooth mutilation,"Tooth mutilation existed in sub-Saharan Africa, and was found among slaves transported to the New World. A small number of mutilation cases have been identified in early New World “Negro” skeletons from the Caribbean and Florida. The skeletal evidence alone precludes determining if the individuals were African- or American-born, but limited ethnohistorical data suggested the former. This hypothesis is considerably strengthened by evidence from 18th-century runaway slave advertisements found in the newspapers of five mainland British colonies. Analysis of these ads shows that every runaway who is identified with tooth mutilation came from Africa. This ethnohistorical evidence supports other sets of bioarchaeological and ethnohistorical data that the African custom of tooth mutilation was not generally practiced by Caribbean or North American slaves. Where filed or chipped teeth appear on skeletons “racially” identified as African in New World sites, there is an excellent chance that the individuals were African-born."
1994,Toward a global historical archaeology: An example from Brazil,"Schuyler has recently argued that historical archaeologists can make their greatest contribution to knowledge by preparing “historic ethnographies,” detailed studies of specific communities. Even though Schuyler’s view has merit, no study of the modern world—including historical archaeology—can be truly complete without considering the many connections that were normally maintained by inhabitants of historical sites. Historical archaeology must be a global, broadly conceived field that looks beyond the site to the wider world. The runaway slave community of Palmares in Brazil illustrates this position."
1994,Zooarchaeological analysis of a free African community: Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose,"Vertebrate remains from Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, near St. Augustine, Florida, provide a unique opportunity to examine African foodways at what may have been the first legally sanctioned, free, African town within the boundaries of what today is the United States of America. The collection contained 28,592 bones and an estimated 281 individuals. When data from Mose are compared to those from the nearby Nombre de Dios Native American village, it is clear that the refuse from Mose contained a higher percentage of domestic animals than did Native American refuse, although the subsistence strategies practiced by each group were similar in other respects. Compared to residents of St. Augustine, the people at Mose may have used less domestic meat. Slaves on coastal plantations later had greater access to domestic meat than did the residents of Mose and St. Augustine. These data suggest a high degree of self-sufficiency at Mose."
1994,Evidence for folkways and cultural exchange in the 18th-century South Carolina Backcountry,"Settlers along the 18th-century South Carolina frontier practiced a diversified economy in which material goods were often manufactured in the home or acquired from local crafters. The knowledge required for homesteading was derived from folk traditions. Archaeological information related to architecture, foodways, and textile manufacture illustrates the importance of folkways at the Howell site, a frontier plantation. Recovered information demonstrates the backcountry was characterized by cultural exchange between European, African, and Native Americans. The following article proposes that multicultural exchange resulted in the syncretism of foodways and textile traditions at the study site."
1994,Material culture of the Koasati Indians of Texas,"This article discusses the types of European trade goods and materials found at 19th-century Koasati (or Coushatta) Indian sites in Texas, particularly those from the Carl Matthews site (41PK2) in the Trinity River basin in southeast Texas. Discovered by an archaeologist from the University of Texas in 1933, the Carl Matthews site appears to have been occupied ca. 1820–1835 by the Koasati Indians, immigrants from Alabama and Georgia who had first moved into the Spanish province of Texas around 1800. Carl Matthews may be the Upper Village of the Koasati visited in 1831 by Jose Francisco y Madero, a land commissioner for the Mexican province of Coahuila y Tejas."
1994,Searching for nineteenth-century Florida water bottles,"Florida Water is a perfumed spirit that became to 19th-century North Americans what Lavender Water and eau-de-cologne were to Europeans. Nowadays, perfumed spirits are known as colognes or toilet waters, and are used mainly as fragrances. But from the Middle Ages right into the 19th century, perfumed spirits were thought to possess miraculous healing properties and to prevent infection. Florida Water is a late arrival to that tradition. Developed in the United States, Florida Water was already a generic product by the 1830s. During the last three decades of the 19th century, many North American druggists and pharmaceutical houses produced their own Florida waters, and also sold Murray and Lanman’s Florida Water, the most popular of the brand-name Florida waters. Two standard bottle shapes were used for Florida Water in the late 19th century. One of these forms is no longer remembered as a Florida Water bottle; without paper labels, examples of this shape are not easily identifiable as Florida Water bottles, and have not yet been studied. Consequently, this article is a request for information on these bottles, and presents preliminary research on Florida Water."
1994,Betty’s hope windmill: An unexpected problem,"It happens all the time in archaeology. One begins what promises to be a routine excavation of a familiar structure. Assumptions are formed about how things are supposed to work in a given situation—assumptions based on education, experience, and the spatial layout of sites. Then unexpected features are encountered. One anticipates a solution, but it never quite emerges; and in the end one reluctantly settles for interpretations that are not entirely logical or satisfactory. Such is the case with the recent excavations at the north windmill on Betty’s Hope Estate in Antigua, West Indies, now the site of a major restoration project. To understand the problem posed by the Betty’s Hope windmill—How did the sugar juice get from the windmill to the factory?—the reader first must understand the spatial layout and operation of a sugar plantation."
1993,Not by bones alone: Exploring household composition and socioeconomic status in an isolated historic mining community,"Archaeological excavations in the historic townsite of Grantsville, Nevada, were conducted in a variety of contexts including dugouts, houses, and a blacksmith shop. Investigations at 12 features retrieved a modest yet spatially variable assemblage of food bones, largely represented by domestic taxa (i.e., cow, pig, and sheep). Faunal quantity, variety, and serving size helped discern household composition and the frequency of food preparation. Faunal quality, regardless of quantification technique, tended not to correspond with ceramic socioeconomic indicators recovered across these same features. By reviewing mid- to late 19th-century western foodways to derive implications for archaeological faunal assemblages, and by considering systemic variability in isolated historic communities, the data suggest that in such cases ceramics manifest a more reliable indicator of feature-specific socioeconomic status than do food bones."
1993,"The cultural creation of the feminine gender: An example from 19th-century military households at Fort Independence, Boston","While military site analyses are prominent in archaeological literature, the roles of women at military garrisons are rarely considered (Gramly 1978; Faulkner 1986; Fisher 1987; Miville-Deschennes 1987; Seidel 1990; Staski 1990). Archaeological excavation from Fort Independence, Boston, however, reveals that women socialized and lived at the garrison during the 19th century (Stokinger and Moran 1978; Clements 1989). The present discussion attempts to review and reinterpret the documentary and archaeological material from Fort Independence to remediate the lack of information pertaining to women at military sites. Beyond making women visible this discussion will consider gender attributes, gendered activities, gendered structures and spaces, and the differential use of material culture associated with gender. In this way the normative nature of gender roles within the military environment is exposed, and support is given to anthropological interpretations of the cultural creation of the feminine gender."
1993,"The Spanish colonial kiln tradition of Moquegua, Peru","Twenty-six kiln locations have been identified in association with Spanish colonial bodegas (wineries) in the Moquegua valley of southern Peru. The kilns are variable in size, design, and construction, and their differences may relate to the two probable functions of the kilns: firing earthenware vessels used in fermenting and transporting wine and brandy, and calcining calcium minerals or other materials. The Moquegua kilns show similarities to the hornos árabes (Moorish kilns) of Spain, as well as some features common to Spanish technological transfer in the New World."
1993,The importance of aspect to historic farmstead site location in the green mountains of vermont,"Historic upland farmstead sites, common to the cultural landscape of the Green Mountains of Vermont, constitute a rich source of data for the historical archaeologist. Although most structures are now in ruin amid regenerating northern hardwood forest, they still retain integrity in terms of physical location. Environmental variables such as elevation, slope, aspect, and soils, all important determinants to a predominantly 19th-century agrarian settlement, are still associated with site location. This article examines the role of one important physical factor, aspect, in the selection of 200 historic farmstead locations. Viewed from the position of ecological anthropology, it appears that farmers in Vermont’s Green Mountains possessed a folk wisdom about solar energy and put it into practice with respect to the location of their farmhouses, fields, and pastures."
1993,"The reliability of geophysical surveys at historic-period cemeteries: An example from the plains cemetery, mechanicsville, Maryland","Remote-sensing techniques have considerable potential for examining the structure of the archaeological record with minimum disturbance. This article examines two techniques, ground-penetrating radar and proton magnetometer surveys, which were used at a historic-period cemetery in southern Maryland. The reliability of these two techniques is assessed against the results of subsequent archaeological testing. Findings from this assessment are then used to suggest refinements in the interpretation of future surveys."
1993,A ceramic chemistry archive for New Netherland/New York,"Compositional analysis has made important contributions to studies of artifact provenience and technological change, but it is rarely used in U.S. historical archaeology. This article presents a non-technical description of the New Netherland/ New York ceramic chemistry archive, detailing methods used in the New York area to explore the chemical dimension of archaeological materials primarily from the historic period. Examples of preliminary results are offered to illustrate the archive’s potential; however, the article emphasizes research design. Theoretical and procedural topics of interest to archaeologists are discussed, including the cultural significance of compositional data, sampling strategy, recovery tactics for buried clays (such as resistivity probing, branded-brick sampling, and tapping of municipal borings), and interpretive problems. In addressing issues of project planning, the authors seek to encourage the establishment of archives in other areas that will facilitate inter-regional and international studies of ceramic production and trade."
1993,White columns and black hands: Class and classification in the plantation ideology of the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry,"Social relations on the plantations of the South Carolina and Georgia Lowcountry were structured by a series of classifications which in turn expressed and codified plantation ideology. Racism, paternalism, and emergent capitalism have all been demonstrated through archaeological investigations as major constellations within this ideological universe. The expression of these social and ideological relations occurred symbolically within the plantations, as evidenced by settlement systems, architecture, and material remains. This ideology was also expressed in the documentary record in the ways in which planters classified their slaves and other social groups. This article considers the archaeology of ideology among the plantations of the Georgia and South Carolina Lowcountry as expressed through symbolization and classification and examines the evolution of plantation ideology from the 17th century to the end of the Antebellum era. It suggests that the social and ideological structure shifted from one based on racial classification to one dependent on labor specialization and social stratification, in response to changes in the Lowcountry’s plantation economy."
1993,"Ethnicity and firearms in the Upper Missouri bison-robe trade: An examination of weapon preference and utilization at Fort Union Trading post N.H.S., North Dakota","Modern fur trade lore suggests that 19th-century native Americans and Euroamericans preferred some types of firearms over others; e.g., smoothbore muskets were the weapons of choice, rifles were of secondary importance, and pistols were relatively insignificant. These assumptions were tested using two data sets relating to Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site, North Dakota. Fort Union (1828–1867) was the principal trading post of the Upper Missouri Outfit. Primary documents (store inventories and shipping manifests) were reviewed to determine the relative popularity of each firearm type within the Native American trading community. Firearms-related artifacts derived from 1968–1972 archaeological excavations at Fort Union are used to ascertain patterns of firearm use by the post’s primarily Euroamerican inhabitants."
1993,Notes on the Cultural origins and functions of Sub-Floor pits,"A review of the current literature demonstrates that sub-floor and sub-surface “cellars” occur in many cultural, chronological, and functional contexts, and that many uses may produce pit features reminiscent of the hearth-front slave root cellars documented at Kingsmill Plantation. Recent site documentation at a 19th-century Virginia farmstead indicates that among some groups one original function might be as borrow for hearth fill or chimney mortar. Such pits might then be adapted for use as sub-floor storage. The review leads to several conclusions. First, the presence of a sub-floor pit should not be taken as prima facie evidence of root storage, storage of valuables, or of African-American occupation; instead, the assigning of ethnicity and site function must rely on a broad view of assemblage attributes. Second, the potential importance of sub-surface pits is such that Phase I testing strategies should add larger test units to the more typical shovel test research design. Third, problem-oriented research is needed to provide an objective basis for cultural and behavioral interpretations, and to identify the modifying influences of taphonomic factors on abandoned sub-floor pits."
1993,Indian corn and Dutch pots: Seventeenth-century foodways in New Amsterdam/New York,"Foodways of every colonizing European group changed in the New World, but, before the changes can be assessed, it is necessary to know what foods and food-related artifacts were common and available in the mother countries. Dutch foodways can be described using documents, excavated artifacts, and genre paintings. New York City began as a Dutch colony, and its foodways in the 17th century reflected this origin. Modifications in Dutch-American utilization of European domestic plants and animals were similar to changes in neighboring British colonies, but artifacts, specifically ceramics, remained recognizably Dutch well after the British annexation of the colony in 1664."
1993,"Commercial Foods, 1740–1820","Commercial food packaging, in both bulk and unit sizes, can be found in archaeological assemblages. Newspaper advertisements from the ca. 1740 to 1820 period provide information on the shape, size, and contents of wood, metal, glass, ceramic, and fiber containers. The advertisements also show that elements of consumerism, in the form of brand names, distinctive packaging, unit packaging, international markets, fixed prices, ready-made items, and targeted markets, were practiced in the food industry by the early years of the 19th century."
1993,Health and diet in 19th-century America: A food historian’s point of view,"This historical survey of health and diet is intended to complement current archaeological food studies and is therefore fairly general. In the interest of painting a broad picture, this essay draws on a number of different kinds of material including period nutrition theories, cookbooks, home and professional cookery, established English-American cuisine, ethnic adaptations, and technological advances. The conglomerate suggests that health ideals and dietary practices mirrored the changing character of the century, moving unevenly from rural to urban focus through developing networks of industry, transportation, and communication. Folklore and quackery, attacked by a variety of reformers, began to give way under new scientific discoveries, social homogenization, commercialization, and government regulation."
1993,Where is night soil? Thoughts on an urban privy,"Looking for night soil, the classic privy deposit, may be futile in a mid- to late 19th-century urban privy. What there is, however, offers information about health, sanitation, and diet. It also reveals something about attitudes toward the laws instituted to protect the well-being of city dwellers. The information presented here came from a review of the literature and laws regarding the management of human waste, and from deposits found in two mid- to late 19th-century privies located in New York City’s Greenwich Village. It also incorporates research about contemporaneous attitudes toward waste management and the technology available to accomplish this task. Using field, analytical, and documentary data, some explanations for the condition and contents of a mid- to late 19th-century urban privy are suggested."
1993,The meaning of change in urban faunal deposits,"Much of what appears as variation between faunal deposits may be the result of a number of different factors, each with their own effects. This article attempts to delineate some of these factors and their effects, so that distinctions among them may ultimately be made. The data used come from three sites in lower Manhattan. A method of assessing food costs in certain deposits is also proposed, and a method suggested by Binford, Grayson, Lyman, and Thomas to identify taphonomic processes is evaluated."
1993,"Public aesthetics versus personal experience: Worker health and well-being in 19th-century Lowell, Massachusetts","Documentary and archaeological evidence provides seemingly contradictory views of conditions of sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition under the boardinghouse system in Lowell, Massachusetts. Archaeological evidence, for example, reveals that public expression of corporate concern for worker welfare often failed to result in actions that would improve living conditions in the boardinghouses. On the other hand, boarders and keepers alike made efforts to humanize and personalize the anonymous surroundings of corporation housing. This situation is revealed through personal accounts as well as by objects of everyday life recovered from archaeological deposits in the backlots of two Boott Corporation boardinghouses. Both documents and archaeology reveal that despite the penetration of elements of 19th-century domestic ideology (e.g., notions of economy and scientific housekeeping) into the design, operation, and maintenance of the Lowell boardinghouses, workers and keepers retained traditional notions of health and nutrition. Historical research and zooarchaeological analysis reveal that workers living in corporation housing had a diet dominated by fatty meats and foods high in starch and carbohydrates, but documents do not imply there was dissatisfaction with food in the boardinghouses; on the contrary, workers believed that their diet was nutritious and healthful. It is suggested that the tendency to interpret the archaeological evidence for sanitary conditions and food remains according to the strictly “objective” criteria of current ideas about health and nutrition can be misleading or at best can bring into focus only part of the picture. Documentary analysis aimed at eliciting the emic perspective of contemporary observers must temper efforts at “science.”"
1993,"The society for historical archaeology, 1967–1992: A quarter century of a national archaeological society","Periodization of the first two and a half decades of the Society for Historical Archaeology (SHA) from its 1967 founding in Dallas to its 25th Annual Meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, reveals a gradual evolution quickened by brief, non-contiguous periods of rapid change. These periods are designated the “Three Agendas” of Formation (ca. 1967–1969), Revitalization (ca. 1979–1982), and Expansion (ca. 1992–?). Such “Agendas” are caused by crises, not normal societal activity, and although predetermined they may or may not be recognized or completed."
1993,Late sixteenth-century basque banded copper kettles,"Copper kettles banded with iron and copper supports originated from Basque ports in southern France between 1580 and 1600. These kettles are substantially different in style of manufacture from the more common folded-over sheet lug kettles recovered from archaeological sites dating to the 17th century. The distribution of these kettles, and distinctive fragments from them, assist in reconstructing late 16th-and early 17th-century exchange networks between the Canadian Maritimes and the lower Great Lakes."
1993,European ceramics and the elusive “Cittie of Raleigh”,"Since 1947 archaeologists have sought to identify the location of the “Lost Colony’s” settlement, the “Cittie of Raleigh.” However, the exact location of this 16th-century habitation site has remained elusive due in part to the greater antiquity and transitory nature of this site’s occupation vis-à-vis later English New World settlements. Now, at the time of the Columbian Quincentenary, archaeological research on other 16th-century sites has revealed, in growing detail, the varied manifestations of the European Old and New World experiences. One aspect of this current research is the more accurate identification of European-made ceramics as to age and point of origin. This article reviews and reevaluates the ceramic collections made during past excavations at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site, North Carolina, and suggests approaches to future research at the site."
1993,"Pollen-record formation processes, interdisciplinary archaeology, and land use by mill workers and managers: The Boott Mills Corporation, Lowell, Massachusetts, 1836–1942","The pollen content of a soil profile is altered by natural processes that destroy pollen and move it downward in the profile. This downward movement separates older pollen from younger in slowly accumulating profiles and produces a spectrum with larger concentrations of pollen at the top of the profile and more pollen that appears degraded at the bottom. Archaeological site formation processes may be evaluated by comparison with this natural spectrum. When this pattern appears in an archaeological profile, cultural deposition has been slow. In places where there was more human activity, soil compression and faster sediment deposition preclude pollen percolation. These soil compression and fast sedimentation processes produce pollen concentrations that correlate with shifts in pollen types and reflect the relative density of vegetation. Reversals of the natural pollen concentration and degradation patterns and pollen concentrations shifting abruptly without clear stratigraphic boundaries in the soil reflect buried and exposed episodic fills and soil disturbance of several kinds. These pollen-record formation processes are used to define the nature and intensity of residential land use by mill workers and mill managers in 19th-century Lowell, Massachusetts."
1993,Beer cans: A guide for the archaeologist,"Beer cans are potentially useful as tools for dating later components in historical sites, and for determining the time of intrusion into prehistoric sites. Changes in major and minor design features are sufficiently documented to yield age estimates accurate to within five years of production. Even in cases of poor can preservation, general trends in shape and construction should provide an estimate accurate to within a decade. This article details both morphological and stylistic changes for the purpose of providing a basic guide to the dating of beer cans."
1993,"“What is the use of plantation archaeology?” no use at all, if no one else is listening!","This essay is a brief response to the commentary by Parker Potter, Jr. (1991) addressing the lack of self-reflection in plantation archaeology. While plantation archaeologists should seriously consider much of Potter’s discussion, it is argued here that Potter is wrong in assuming that African Americans are the main audience for plantation archaeology and that the only way information from plantation archaeology reaches the general public is through direct communication, such as public presentations and museum exhibits. The audience for plantation archaeology divides not along racial lines but intellectual lines. The primary audience is scholars, who then pass on the results of scholarly research to the general public through their teaching activities at universities, colleges, and museums. Therefore, the question that needs to be addressed is, Has plantation archaeology made any contribution to wider scholarship? It is argued here that scholars in other disciplines have found nothing of use to them in plantation archaeology and have, by and large, ignored this research. Plantation archaeologists can make a significant contribution to broader scholarship, but to do this, they need to make their research relevant to other scholars, incorporate the theoretical and substantive developments in other disciplines, and address the questions that no other discipline can answer. Only then will the full potential of plantation archaeology be realized."
1992,Replication and experimental archaeology,"The construction or replication of objects, assemblies, or processes, and their subsequent testing are the next steps in any complete exercise in anthropological archaeology. This has been called “experimental archaeology,” because it allows testing of conclusions reached through normal avenues of research, fine-tunes these conclusions, or determines the order of steps in a procedure through replication. “Replica” is often used very loosely, i.e., in reference to efforts to provide sets for theatrical events or part of a promotion. In fact, experimental archaeology differs greatly from mere copies or reconstructions and there are strict limits on its efficacy. After an experiment is successfully carried through to completion, it is impossible to say that the ancients did the same thing, but only that they may have used the same technique. Even if the archaeologist is able to establish convincingly how a procedure was accomplished, the question remains, “But why?”"
1992,Replicating fifteenth- and sixteenth-century ordnance,"One of the principal reasons for the success of European voyages of discovery in the late 15th and early 16th centuries was that each ship was a floating fortress, bristling with an array of devastating weaponry. Analyses of the extensive and varied ordnance and projectiles found on the Molasses Reef and Highborn Cay wrecks spurred experiments in the replication of a type of shot found predominantly in discovery era contexts. These trials in the casting of “composite” iron-cored lead shot, using comparable raw materials and a shot mold from the Molasses Reef wreck, have solved the decades-old riddle of how they were manufactured. Other experiments in the replication of exploratory period ordnance have been designed. Potential benefits from such experiments include compilation of the first empirical data on the true range, effectiveness, and rate of fire of such weapons, as well as estimates of useful life expectancy, minimum effective gun crew sizes, and limitations of tactical employment."
1992,Replicating a caravel,"The building of discovery-period ships for the specific purpose of testing the accuracy of carefully determined but hypothetical designs seems to be a more useful approach to replication than fanciful celebratory inventions. Before an experimental replica ship of any type can be built, a number of prerequisites must be met: Sufficient reliable information must be available. All avenues of research—archaeology, history, and ethnology—must be exhausted. An inventory of the technology available to the original shipwrights must be taken. This article outlines the process of replicating an early 16th-century caravel from the formation of a reliable hypothesis through the process of construction, fitting out, fine-tuning, and testing."
1992,Replicating a voyage of discovery,"Building and sailing replica ships is not an uncommon phenomenon. Often, the replica is built to prove that a certain ship type could have crossed a particular body of water, to make a cameo appearance at a tall ships’ rendezvous, or to commemorate the anniversary of an historic voyage. Some replicas have been more authentic than others, but the voyages themselves seldom strive to achieve authenticity. Given the enormous investment the builder has in his replica, it is not surprising that he usually considers the project a success if the vessel completes its maiden voyage safely. Testing the replica’s seaworthiness in a variety of sea conditions and using the information obtained to fine-tune or improve the ship are seldom seriously considered. This paper presents a case for replicating a voyage of discovery and proposes a solution to the vexing problem of what to with the replica once the experiments are over."
1992,Replicating a voyage of discovery,"Between 1978 and 1988, the Yorktown Shipwreck Archaeological Project employed a wide range of technological tools during the location, assessment, and excavation of British vessels sunk during the Battle of Yorktown in 1781. The most unique aspect of the project was the utilization of a steel cofferdam and filtration system to offset adverse site conditions and assist the excavation team. The project also made use of remote sensing instruments, computer-aided drafting technology, and a new sonic measurement system."
1992,USS Monitor: Results from the 1987 season,"In 1987, the wreck site of USS Monitor was the scene of a systematic gathering of baseline archaeological data to assess the condition of the wreck. Advanced oceanographic tools, a ROV, and a sonar-based positioning system were used to carry out the project. Four tasks were planned and executed: (1) to define the extent of the archaeological site through analysis of the artifact scatter away from the wreck proper; (2) to make a controlled photographic map of the hull in plan and elevation views; (3) to study the corrosion processes at the site; and (4) to acquire 35-mm stereo photographs of selected specific details of the vessel’s construction for historical engineering analysis. Additionally, the opportunity arose to carry out a fifth task, the acquisition of detailed, close-range, high-resolution imagery of the hull by sector-scanning sonar. With the present study accomplished it became apparent that the site is rapidly being destroyed by human and natural causes. Active steps to preserve the Monitor are recommended up to and including the complete recovery of the wreck and its contents."
1992,Threatened James River shipwreck and historical sites,"Historical records of shipwrecks in the James River indicate that large numbers of vessels were wrecked, abandoned, or scuttled there during the 18th and 19th centuries. These physical elements of maritime history are central to the history of Virginia and the United States and can yield valuable information, yet, many of these sites have been destroyed by looting and through regular dredging of the river. State and federal agencies have been largely unaware of the archaeological potential of the river and, until recently, unresponsive to notices that government inaction allowed important archaeological sites to be destroyed. This article describes several large archaeological sites: the wrecks of USS Cumberland and CSS Florida in Hampton Roads, the City Point wharves and anchorage, and two sunken fleets at Drewry’s Bluff; discusses threats to the sites; looting, maintenance dredging, and channel widening projects; considers governmental responsibility and complex ownership issues; and finally makes recommendations for resolution of the management problems associated with shipwrecks in the James."
1992,"Recovering the past of USS Arizona: Symbolism, myth, and reality","Archaeological investigation of the battleship USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor provided the first assessment of a shipwreck that included its mythic and symbolic importance. The study of Arizona also demonstrated material evidence of anticipatory recycling and a sense of strategic vulnerability, while also demonstrating the influence of alternative views of the past."
1992,Shipwreck allocation and management in Michigan: A review of theory and practice,"Shipwrecks within Michigan’s Great Lakes provide benefits to users who include historians, archaeologists, sport divers, anglers, salvors, and businesspeople. But as common property resources, shipwrecks are subject to overuse and misallocation that are characteristic of the “tragedy of the commons.” With the passage of state legislation in 1980, shipwrecks are now formally recognized as public trust resources to be managed wisely for the benefits of present and future Michigan citizens. The values of these benefits and the costs of impacts from use should be considered in making allocation and resource management decisions. In addition, the establishment of institutional management systems is needed to guide, monitor, and control the use of shipwrecks. Michigan has established nine underwater preserves and is investigating private-public partnerships in shipwreck management that include community support groups as decision-makers. Strategic planning processes and collaborative decision-making approaches offer some means for designing effective resource management tactics that are consistent with the missions of state agencies. Strategic planning processes relevant to shipwreck management include inventory and assessment of resources, citizen participation and community development approaches, and the marketing of parks, recreation, and tourism."
1992,Recent advances in close range photogrammetry for underwater historical archaeology,"Until recently close range photogrammetry has been exclusively done with dual or single cameras using a methodology termed stereoscopic photogrammetry. Likewise, it has been the only photogrammetric methodology used underwater. Convergent photogrammetry offers a faster, less expensive and more accurate methodology for the recording of underwater historical sites. The principles common to both forms of photogrammetry are reviewed so the differences stand out more clearly to the reader. Two examples of the application of convergent photogrammetry are presented—a test case conducted in a controlled environment and an actual field problem—so as to make the theory and method more understandable."
1992,The Ethics of Collaboration: Archaeologists and the Whydah project,"The ethical dimensions of archaeological collaboration with treasure hunters are explored through a study of the Whydah salvage project. The Whydah, a pirate ship that sank off Cape Cod in 1717, has been the object of commercial salvage since 1982, which has resulted in intense ethical and legal controversy among treasure hunters, archaeologists, and public officials. The article describes the history of archaeological involvement in the salvage project and discusses the issue of collaboration from the perspective of the archaeologists who work for the treasure hunters and those in public agencies who regulate them. The ethical problems of archaeological collaboration are discussed in light of ethical standards of modern archaeology. The effects of archaeological collaboration in the Whydah project are assessed and the growing acceptance of commercial salvors in the management of underwater cultural resources is demonstrated with reference to recent projects in Boston Harbor."
1992,Is it treasure or a worthless piece of ship?,"In response to a recent increase in treasure hunting ventures, and the ethical positions taken by professional archaeological associations, the Council of American Maritime Museums and the International Congress of Maritime Museums have developed specific guidelines and recommendations for the collecting and exhibiting of archaeological materials. In particular, objects from commercially exploited archaeological sites are prohibited, to reduce the market in these artifacts and prevent the perception that museums foster and/or condone the looting of archaeological shipwreck sites."
1992,The second destruction of the Geldermalsen,"This review of C. J. A. Jörg’s book on the Chinese porcelain from the Dutch East India Company ship Geldermalsen, which sank in 1752, addresses some broader questions involved in the destruction of shipwreck sites for commercial profit. These questions grew out of the issue of what relationship scholars should have with those who destroy sites and acquire objects from them. The first part of the article is a review of Jörg’s book, followed by a commentary on the problems that collecting from looted sites raise."
1992,Post-Processual approaches to meanings and uses of material culture in historical archaeology,Discussions of post-processual archaeology are summarized in order to suggest that historical archaeology is in a particularly good position to answer the post-processual critiques of the “new” archaeology and to create a contextual archaeology that is both historically and anthropologically informed and relevant. The work of four scholars is noted as particularly influential in the development of post-processual approaches.
1992,Discourse on the frontiers of history: Material culture and social reproduction in Early Scotland,"The historical archaeology of early Medieval Scotland is of interest outside of Britain because, unlike much of Europe, Scotland experienced little direct intervention from the Roman Empire. Early Scotland has left few contemporary documents and is therefore only barely historical; consequently archaeology has always played a significant role in the study of its origins. That role has generally been to provide illustrations for historical discussions, especially in the case of the Picts who occupied what was to become the core of the Scottish state. This study suggests how the archaeological evidence can be used to go beyond mere illustration and beyond the limitations of the aristocratic interests which are embodied in the contemporary sources and to begin writing a representative social history. The concept of fields of discourse is used to provide a materialist method for integrating texts and artifacts. Attention here is focused on the architecture of the hillforts, the significance of the Symbol Stones, and on the settlement patterns as revealed by aerial photography."
1992,"Knowledge, constraint, and power in inaction: The defenseless medieval wall","This paper offers some analytical approaches to the social history of medieval walls around towns, castles, villas, monasteries, and fields, using the themes of symbolism, knowledge, constraint, power, and conflict. Walls separate space into the inside and outside, each rife with symbolic meaning, defining areas of authority or symbolizing possession. Walls constrain movement, and through the physical obstacle created, walls remove ambiguity from passage; they impart knowledge of “illegal” entry or exit. Such knowledge is power, but more power is conferred by the ability to control movement, whether of political foes or of merchants wishing to trade. Because walls symbolize authority and power to control or rights of ownership, they frequently are the center of social tension and conflict. These topics are discussed with the recurring subtheme of the relationship of feudal and capitalist political and economic systems to walls around towns and around fields."
1992,Meanings of polite architecture in sixteenth-century England,"This paper argues that the aristocracy and upper gentry in 16th-century England manipulated symbolic structures relating to the feudal past to lend ideological support to the Tudor social order. It does so by applying the concept of consumption to the building and use of “polite” architecture. Through the use of medieval features such as crenelation, the gatehouse, the moat, and decorative use of emblems and badges, the 16th-century house expressed and enforced its owner’s claims to be part of a long-established social order. At the same time, the changing arrangement and use of rooms behind this façade displayed a more complex pattern of change. These patterns are related to a series of case studies in which the owners’ uses of specific symbols can be related to their chosen strategy in maintaining and extending this position near the apex of Tudor society."
1992,"Consumer behavior in colonial charlestown, Massachusetts, 1630–1760","This paper examines consumer behavior of the Massachusetts Bay seaport of Charlestown from 1630 to 1760. Probate inventories and archaeological excavation of residential sites provide the data. The material lives of consumers were structured by shifting cultural values which included an emphasis on the family as primary social unit as well as a value placed on the emerging new role of the individual. Consumer strategies including patina, innovation, and emulation both reflected and influenced the direction of culture change."
1992,Modern Discipline: Its historical context in the colonial Chesapeake,"This study examines the development of Western society’s modern way of life and demonstrates how consumerism and its behavioral correlates actively shaped and created behavior in an industrializing society. This essay reviews some of the ideas regarding the symbolic uses of material goods and describes the historical context in which goods related to a modern discipline appeared in 18th-century Annapolis, Maryland. During times of economic stress or within a competitive system, or when the existing social order is being threatened, goods and their meanings will create overt distinctions between groups and standardize behavior in order to reinforce and strengthen the social hierarchy."
1992,Explicit and implicit meanings in material culture and print culture,"Results of analysis of 18th- and 19th-century printers’ type suggest complex relationships among technology, print culture, capitalism, standardization, and both explicit and implicit meanings of material culture. The metaphorical meanings of goods are offered as a guide to interpreting the recursiveness of standardization, which is examined as an attribute of both print culture and the culture of capitalism."
1992,"Beneath the material surface of things: Commodities, artifacts, and slave plantations","Archaeologists understand that artifacts can be studied from many different perspectives. Among such analytical possibilities, viewing artifacts as commodities—objects produced for exchange within concrete social contexts—provides an excellent way for historical archaeologists to conceptualize the important roles material objects play in capitalist societies. This perspective accepts that artifacts have both economic and social lives. Within the historic period, slave plantations provide an excellent research universe in which to evaluate the applicability of the artifacts-as-commodities approach."
1992,"Consumption as communication in nineteenth-century Paradise Valley, Nevada","Historical archaeologists have studied consumption practices to identify social categories like class or ethnicity, and processes like emerging capitalism and industrialism. This paper examines the material culture of 19th-century Paradise Valley, Nevada, in terms of consumption as a process of communication. This model allows the integration of a broad range of material culture categories, from the bottles and tin cans of consumer goods to agricultural machinery, household appliances, and residential and commercial architecture. It also describes connections between local and national scale changes in the material culture and avoids a more limited causality focused on either measures of the penetration of capitalist social and economic organization, or the resistance of local forms and norms to national trends."
1992,Critical Archaeology: In the ground and on the street,"This paper is composed of two very different parts, linked by a single concept, the idea of recursivity. The first part of the paper deals with the construction of artifact analyses within the framework of critical archaeology. The second part discusses the public performance of critical archaeological interpretations. The link between these two seemingly disparate enterprises is an understanding that material culture has the capacity to teach its users ways of thinking and behaving. This active quality of material culture is what is called recursivity."
1992,Epilogue: The productive nature of material culture and archaeology,This essay examines the implications of the use of the idea of recursivity applied to material culture. This idea is contrasted with definitions of material culture used within New Archaeology. Implications of understanding recursiveness of both material culture and archaeological interpretation are discussed by examining the relationship between archaeological interpretations and present-day society.
1992,Where’s the beef? Food supply at an antebellum frontier post,"The range of sources used by the American frontier military for food supplies in the period immediately preceding the Civil War is examined. The discussion focuses on material (particularly the faunal remains) excavated from the site of Cantonment Burgwin (1852–1860), an army post located in north-central New Mexico on the western margin of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains (southern Rockies). Archival data are drawn both from sources associated directly with the post as well as from sources associated with the larger Department of New Mexico military command. Although a paucity of provenience information for the faunal data hampers the inferences which can be made, it is provisionally concluded that opportunistic purchasing on the local market combined with a primary subsistence base strongly tied to the East helped insure survival of the post in the antebellum Southwest."
1992,"An X-ray fluorescence-pattern recognition analysis of pottery from an early historic hispanic settlement near Santa Fe, New Mexico","The results from a cluster analysis of x-ray fluorescence data on pottery sherds from a rare 17th-century Spanish colonial site are used to make a preliminary identification of the Pueblo origins of these ceramics and to examine the socio-economic interactions between the colonists and the indigenous Pueblo Indians. This work not only provides a needed data base on elemental compositions of Pueblo pottery in the area just to the south of Santa Fe, it also demonstrates that the nearest pueblo was not necessarily the only or even the major source of the pottery present at such sites. Several cultural factors in 17th-century Spanish colonial New Mexico—the tribute (encomienda) system, class, status, and gender—are briefly considered for the role they may have played in determining the distribution of pottery sources found at the site, LA 20,000."
1992,Architectural symbolism and non-verbal communication at upper fort garry,"The archival research component of the Upper Fort Garry Archaeological Project recovered extensive detailed information on the architectural history of the fort. It quickly became clear that the changes in architecture during the fort’s occupancy (1836–1881) corresponded closely to economic and social changes in the Red River Settlement at large. Built by the Hudson’s Bay Company to house its administrative elite in North America, the fort played a central role, both physically and conceptually, in the life of the settlement. This article takes a non-verbal communication approach to the fort and examines it as a set of architectural symbols by means of which the Hudson’s Bay Company established and maintained its dominant position in economic and social relations with its employees and with settlers."
1992,The noncurrency functions of Chinese wen in America,"Chinese coins from western North American archaeological sites are a dramatic example of artifacts whose primary function changed completely when they changed cultural context. This article provides a review of the known uses of the wen, the most commonly recovered Chinese coin, and presents ethnographic evidence to suggest uses previously unrecognized in the archaeological literature. It is suggested that Chinese wen could not have circulated as currency after crossing the Pacific because they had use-values far exceeding their monetary exchange values."
1992,"Munition artifacts from Fort Fillmore, New Mexico","Numerous munitions artifacts have been recovered from the site of Fort Fillmore, a frontier military outpost in southern New Mexico (1851–1862). Analyses of these materials have led to the following conclusions: (1) officers and enlisted men had access to different types of weaponry; (2) the troops at the fort were armed with weapons on a par with or exceeding normal issue; (3) certain innovations in armament reached the fort rapidly; and (4) factory-produced munition components were present at the site, and there may have been some local production as well. Together, these conclusions suggest that Fort Fillmore was well integrated into an efficient U.S. military system."
1992,Northern Michigan logging camps: Material culture and worker adaptation on the industrial frontier,"Historical and archaeological data from the Hiawatha National Forest in the central Upper Peninsula of Michigan are used to explore the research potential of Great Lakes logging camps. A primary goal is reconstruction of foodways and certain aspects of material culture related to preindustrial traditions. Detailed historical evidence indicates that the loggers preferred ceramic tableware and fresh domestic meats, although metal tableware was dominant and wild game and/or preserved meats were characteristic of early camps and later small-scale operations. A consideration of corporate characteristics, work force ethnicity, and labor supply provides a framework for analysis. Archaeological sites representing four major companies reveal differential accommodation of foodway preferences, as well as evidence of preindustrial worker culture, such as Finnish saunas and camps where families were permitted. Previous interpretation of these characteristics as simply reflecting varying levels of competition for labor seems inadequate. Instead, interaction between worker culture and the industrial environment is stressed, and mutual adaptation is seen as the result."
1992,The archaeology of underdevelopment and the military frontier of Northern New Spain,"Relatively little effort has been devoted to understanding the economic development of the Hispanic military frontier. Archaeologists, historians, and historical sociologists writing on the topic have accepted a model which stresses the dependence created by the Spanish mercantile system. By contrast, the analysis of archaeological data described herein indicates that before 1856 the military colonies (presidios) enjoyed comparative self-sufficiency. During late colonial times (1750–1821) nearly all of the limited amounts of goods imported to the frontier were manufactured in central New Spain. After 1830 this pattern changed, and increasing amounts of European products replaced those made in Mexico. Eventually, the expansion of the industrialized world economy culminated in the creation of recognizable bonds of dependency that linked the presidios to European-dominated capitalism."
1992,"Missions, Indians, and cultural continuity","A technique has been devised for measuring the rate and degree of culture change represented in archaeological assemblages from the California Missions. Using this technique on data from excavations at the missions of Soledad, San Antonio, and La Purisima, shows that while there are differences between these missions, the most important result is that the California Indians maintained a high degree of traditional cultural continuity at all three missions. Using a sequence of assemblages from Mission Soledad, changes through the Mission period are evaluated and interpreted in relation to changes in the economic structure of Spanish and Mexican California."
1992,Some models for Spanish colonial archaeology in California,Nomothetics—the scientific search for general laws and patterns of behavior—is the ultimate goal of inductive archaeology. Specific data from numerous sites can now be used to confirm or disconfirm hypotheses as more general laws about cultural processes. Several interesting models have been generated by archaeologists and scholars in related disciplines that can help to explain the colonial phenomenon. Some of these models will be briefly summarized and applied to the situation in Spanish California.
1992,"Socio-economics and trade in Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico: Observations from the Ballaja Archaeological Project","The testing-phase investigation of the Ballajá Archaeological Project involved the archaeological study of two blocks in Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico. These field studies revealed portions of two of the city’s late 18th- and 19th-century barrios: Santo Domingo, one of the wealthier barrios in the old city, and Ballajá, the city’s 19th-century slum. The late 18th century witnessed Puerto Rico’s entry into a world economy, as trade restrictions were relaxed and goods from beyond the Spanish empire first legally reached the island. The analysis of materials from the Ballajá project indicates that three trading spheres existed during this period: (1) materials produced from outside the Spanish realm, (2) items produced by Spain and her colonies, and (3) items produced locally in Puerto Rico. Participation in each of these trade networks appears to have been linked to social and economic status, with the upper-status occupants of the project area focused on non-Hispanic materials, the middle-status inhabitants relying upon non-local Hispanic goods, and the lower-status residents dependent on locally-produced items. This article examines the relations between socio-economics and trade in 18th- and 19th-century Old San Juan, and discusses the implications of the observed patterns for understanding the colonial Hispanic economy."
1992,Purchasing patterns of the California missions in ca. 1805,"During the first decade of the 19th century, Yankee otter-hunters were trading illegally with the California missions, exchanging manufactured goods for pelts. Two documents of this period, an 1804 Spanish factura (shipping list) and the 1806–1807 account book of the smuggling ship Mercury, reveal differences in the types of items supplied by these two trade networks. Over the next quarter century the Spanish economic system in California would be replaced by the Anglo-based capitalist world economy. The effect of this trend on both Hispanic cultural ties and the material culture of the colony is discernible in these early inventories."
1992,"Material culture and colonial Indian society in Southern Mesoamerica: The view from Coastal Chiapas, Mexico","The native population of the colonial Province of Soconusco, New Spain, cultivated cacao throughout the Spanish colonial period, which provided the means for acquiring relatively large quantities of Spanish-introduced goods. This paper examines the extent to which other aspects of the archaeological record—the settlement pattern, house construction, and indigenous—tradition artifacts—exhibited change and continuity from the Late Postclassic to Spanish colonial periods."
1992,Historic sites archaeology in Mexico,"This paper examines the patterns that characterize the development of historic sites archaeology in Mexico. It emphasizes studies conducted by Mexican researchers. The major trends of historical archaeology in the nation have been influenced by the following factors: the prevailing definition of archaeology, the limits imposed by building restoration programs, and the lack of a theoretical framework and hypothesis in the majority of studies."
1992,The Spanish colonial experience and domestic animals,"European colonial efforts were most successful where the plants and animals they brought with them were most successful. This statement makes it appear that European domestic plants and animals either made it or did not. In fact, European animals went through a period of adaptation to their new situations. These in turn influenced the adjustments humans were making to the colonial experience. Examples of the range of animal and European adaptations are taken from 16th-century Spanish colonial efforts on Hispaniola, Cubagua, and Spanish Florida. These examples show that European animals were present in every case, but the suite of animals used and their role in the human diet varied considerably."
1992,The role of ceramics in Spain and Spanish America during the 16th century,"Using archaeological and historical data, this study examines the various functions of ceramics in Spain during the 16th century and compares a ceramic assemblage from Seville to those from several contemporaneous New World Spanish colonies. The patterned differences between the ceramics recovered from the Old and New World sites are thought to reflect differences in the environment, economy, and demography of the various sites."
1992,Empire and ceramics: The changing role of illicit trade in Spanish America,"Commercial colonial states of the early modern era are noteworthy in their movement of both luxury and bulk goods between the core and the periphery of empires. Frequently, for archaeologists studying the role of trade in the Spanish New World empire, the recovery of imported ceramics of non-Hispanic origins has suggested the presence of foreign interlopers in these closed mercantilist marketplaces. In this study, the ceramic assemblage of colonial Florida is examined against data from the larger Spanish empire to discern more parsimoniously the extent of this perceived illicit trade. Information for this paper is derived from the sites of colonial Santa Elena and St. Augustine in Spanish Florida, as well as from other contemporary Spanish colonial habitation and merchant shipwreck sites in the New World."
1992,Common maiolica types of Northern New Spain,Since 1984 the author has been involved in a series of investigations of sites located in areas that were once part of northern New Spain. The information produced by these studies has been combined to reconstruct the succession of maiolica types and varieties for the period dating from 1550 to 1900. This essay offers a summary description of this sequence.
1992,Compositional identification of Seville majolica at overseas sites,"This study reports compositional data for the first majolica ceramics excavated from a 16th-century kiln site in the Sevillian suburb of Triana. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of 63 of the ceramics provides baseline data for documenting the growth and spread of Spanish majolica industries and networks of supply during the Spanish colonial period. In an initial comparison the kiln site data are shown to match majolica data from the North African Portuguese fort of Qsar es-Seghir (1458–1550) and the New World Spanish mission of Santa Catalina de Guale (1567–1680), confirming that Seville majolica was exported to both settlements. The Santa Catalina samples are from more than one source, however, and some are compositionally unrelated to any Spanish data. Two alternative hypotheses are offered to explain the difference in supply at the two colonies."
1991,“Several paradise ladies are visiting in town”: Gender strategies in the early industrial west,"Gender can provide a powerful interpretive construct in historical archaeology and should not be an optional dimension in archaeological site interpretation. As a central structuring principle of society, gender is not limited to either specific artifact categories and site types or to women per se. Rather, it is a fundamental part of what organizes women and men into historically and archaeologically recognizable units like households and structures their relationships with the larger community and society around them. The following discussion presents a general overview of current approaches to gender in anthropology and history. Two case studies drawn from the 19th-century American West demonstrate some of the implications this discourse has for both the data and the interpretive frameworks employed in historical archaeology."
1991,Gender and historical archaeology: Eastern Dakota patterns in the 19th century,"The investigation of gender in the past has finally begun to receive serious attention from archaeologists. Because of the infancy of the study, however, many theoretical and methodological questions have yet to be resolved concerning the kinds of gendered questions that can be asked of archaeological data and the ways in which archaeological information can inform one about past gender systems. Historical archaeology, because of the availability of historic documents and ethnographic information, can provide crucial information about the ways in which gender is represented in archaeological deposits. This is illustrated in an examination of mortuary data from a 19th-century Dakota cemetery, the Black Dog Burial site. Thirty-nine individuals were interred in 24 different burials with a wide variety of historic Dakota and Euroamerican artifacts. Simple sexto-artifact correlations revealed little evidence of sex-linked artifacts although age-specific artifact categories were found. However, factor analysis did reveal patterns of artifact clusters which may reveal gender categories that are not ascribed on the basis of biological sex. Archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence indicates a more fluid system of gender construction, consistent with Dakota cultural traditions, in spite of intense pressure from Euroamericans to adopt Western gender roles."
1991,The archaeology of women in the Spanish New World,"This paper explores the archaeology of women in Spanish colonial society. While an appreciation of Spanish and Native American women in Hispanic America is gradually emerging, this understanding is still rudimentary and limited almost exclusively to domestic contexts. Similarly, although African women were an important component in many Spanish colonies, their unique contributions are poorly understood."
1991,A feminist approach to historical archaeology: Eighteenth-century fur trade society at Michilimackinac,"Framed by feminist and historical materialist theory, this study puts forth a method for examining gender in historical archaeology and provides an example of this approach. Both written and archaeological records are utilized to examine subsistence in a past community, with the expectation that the social and economic relations operating in the larger community will be revealed when any aspect of daily life is examined in detail. The fur-trading community at Michilimackinac between 1761 and 1781 is the focus of the study. The results suggest several implications for an historical archaeology of gender."
1991,When daddy was a shanty boy: The role of gender in the organization of the logging industry in highland West Virginia,"Literature and oral history of late 19th- and early 20th-century logging camps are replete with stories about lusty loggers who lived rigorous lives in the woods. Photo documentation in many of the logging histories supports the idea that logging was a single-gender, masculine activity. However, it is clear from recent work at the Monongahela National Forest and elsewhere in the East that women and children were present in some logging contexts. This article looks at the historic logging industry in West Virginia using gender as an organizing principle."
1991,Sacred dinners and secular teas: Constructing domesticity in mid-19th-century New York,"In this study, the ceramics from two mid-19th-century middle-class homes in New York’s Greenwich Village are analyzed to begin to explore consumer patterns among the women of this group. The analysis suggests that during this period, “domesticity” was defined differently by women at the poorer and richer ends of the middle-class spectrum."
1991,Within site of the white house: The archaeology of working women,"Gender roles define appropriate behavior for members of society according to sex and age, and appropriate behavior includes appropriate work. The relationship between consumer behavior, household composition, and household function in turn-of-the-century Washington, D.C., is elucidated by understanding women’s work. Archaeological excavations in downtown Washington, D.C.’s, Federal Triangle produced artifact collections from two types of households, working-class households and brothels. For working-class wives, the home was the workplace, and many of these women participated in both paid and unpaid labor without going out to work. Turn-of-the-century brothels were also both workplace and home, but brothels were organized as commercial institutions, not social units. Comparisons of artifact assemblages from a brothel and two working-class households in the neighborhood historically known as Hooker’s Division and assemblages from two other Washington, D.C., neighborhoods indicate different consumer patterns; these patterns reflect differences in household composition and household function."
1991,"Gender, activity areas, and homelots in the 17th-century Chesapeake region","The colonial enterprise in the Chesapeake Tidewater region was first and foremost economic in nature, with the household as its primary unit of tobacco production. Each household, for the most part comprised of both women and men, occupied a homelot surrounded by fields. The economic roles of women and men on the homelot are most easily seen in the archaeological record in terms of activity areas, and it is from such a vantage point that an ethnography of 17th-century gender roles can be approached. Activity areas are documented for three 17th-century homelot sites from two tobacco plantations in southern Maryland with the aid of computer-assisted simulation maps of plow zone artifacts. The range of women’s and men’s activities and their spatial organization are related to differences in household wealth and to the structure of the colonial economy."
1991,"Engendering Visible and invisible ceramic artifacts, especially dairy vessels","This paper moves between two fields—modern artifact analysis (with its practitioners) and 18th-century culture—to show the veils in place that make certain sectors of the population less visible in present-day artifact interpretation. The article assumes that artifacts were not and are not passive entities, but items useful in a variety of ways: as practical tools and as fluid symbolic indicators of masculine and feminine activity. How do artifacts shift from male to female or female to male roles in a home? What happens when they are enmeshed in a folk-oriented mode of production such as family-based dairying? Essentially, when traditionally feminine products such as butter or cheese could be reliably made as household surpluses, women sold them. As the market for dairy products grew, their production was appropriated and reallocated to male arenas—first within and by male household members and later within a factory-based system. This raises the question of whether the movement of dairy production from a female folk world to a male folk world to capitalism can be perceived through artifact analysis. If not, why not? Is it because the events that took place are hidden by the past, or is it that they are masked in the present by modern analytical concerns? A deconstruction of artifact analysis is presented as a guide to this conundrum."
1991,Historical archaeology in the American West: The view from Philadelphia,"An apparent dearth of historical archaeological excavations in western North America is probably an artifact of perception rather than a point of necessary concern. If population and settlement differentials between eastern and western North America are recognized first, then as much historical archaeology occurs west as east of the Mississippi Valley. Perception, even if misleading, is nevertheless significant, and within historical archaeology it should draw attention to a different question. When does the West appear as a distinctive culture area, and how do the internal chronological divisions of its history structure archaeological research?"
1991,Historical archaeology in Arizona and New Mexico,"In Arizona and New Mexico, the conduct of historic sites archaeology extends back nearly 70 years and began as an adjunct to prehistory. Mostly Spanish period sites were investigated in the beginning, but by 1960 Anglo-American and other sites were included as well. With the advent of CRM in the 1970s, most regional projects in historical archaeology have shifted away from the universities to contract archaeologists with little training in the discipline. The consequences have been enormous."
1991,Historical archaeology in California,"Within recent years, rapid changes in the state of California have had major consequences for historical archaeology, both good and bad. On the one hand, the conduct of the discipline in the region is changing toward a focus upon broad systems, the search for context, and the recognition of variability or regularities. The advances are illustrated by recent developments in Overseas Chinese archaeology. On the other hand, however, the data base is threatened increasingly by a hostile social and political climate in the state."
1991,Toward an historical archaeology of the Intermountain West,"Since the 1970s, the amount of historic sites research in the Intermountain West has increased dramatically on a wave of mining and exploration for gas and oil. The conduct of historical archaeology in the region, however, continues to be site-specific and serendipitous without the benefit of regional research strategies. Several interpretive themes that might provide a regional framework are considered in this paper, including the evolution of hydraulic society, uncertain enterprises and boom-bust cycles, the legacy of conquest, frontier urbanism, and dependency upon the federal government."
1991,San Luis de Talimali: The archaeology of Spanish-Indian relations at a Florida Mission,"Despite a historical propensity to characterize the Spanish treatment of Native Americans as brutal, archaeological and historic data gathered since 1984 from religious, civic, and domestic contexts at San Luis have revealed otherwise. It appears that both Spanish and Apalachee residents maintained a strong sense of their respective cultural identities and material life, and demonstrated a marked degree of accommodation."
1991,"Archaeological investigations of a mid-19th-century shipbreaking yard, San Francisco, California","By mid-1850, as a consequence of the California Gold Rush, hundreds of ships from around the world lay at anchor in San Francisco Bay, to the east of the rapidly growing metropolis. As the “argonauts” headed for the Gold Country, scores of these vessels were abandoned in the harbor and left to rot. As the city expanded eastward into the harbor, the least seaworthy ships were towed to the shallows off Rincon Point and scrapped. By the mid-1850s enterprising entrepreneurs commenced San Francisco’s shipbreaking trade. In 1988, construction at the Hills Plaza Site, located at the former tip of Rincon Point, encountered a substantial portion of what had been San Francisco’s largest mid-19th-century shipbreaking yard. The study of portions of Charles Hare’s Gold Rush shipbreaking facility afforded the first opportunity to document archaeologically this type of land-based maritime facility on the West Coast."
1991,"A little slice of heaven: Investigations at Rincon cemetery, Prado Basin, California","Preliminary investigations at an unmarked, late 19th- to early 20th-century cemetery have produced information on little-understood early Californio mortuary practices and culture. The cemetery is associated with the now extinct town of Rincon and may require relocation in the future. Historical records indicate a probable cemetery population of about 90. A proton magnetometer survey of the site identified 82 anomalies representing possible graves. Four of the strongest anomalies were tested, with each producing positive results."
1991,The contents of Charles Cox’s mill house chest,"Recent historical research on an 18th-century grist mill located in Anne Arundel Country, Maryland, identified an instructive document relative to the interpretation of slave-associated archaeological sites. Descriptions of the contents of Charles Cox’s mill house chest provide a documentary analogy for one possible function of archaeological features known as “root cellars.”"
1991,What is the use of plantation archaeology?,"This essay is a commentary on plantation archaeology inspired by a recent article by William H. Adams and Sarah Jane Boling (1989). By asking what is the use of plantation archaeology, this author does not mean to reject this increasingly popular archaeological enterprise. Rather, the purpose is to provoke serious reflection on two issues: (1) the reasons for doing plantation archaeology and (2) the audiences for such studies. The essay has three main parts: a general discussion of the status of self-reflection in plantation archaeology; a specific critique of Adams and Boling’s piece; and a set of four suggestions for improving on Adams and Boling’s work, not by changing their analysis but by paying greater attention to the contexts in which slave-owned ceramics existed in the past and the contexts in which these same objects exist today, as archaeological finds. This commentary is based on critical theory, and on the proposition that, whether it is explicitly interpreted for the public or not, any archaeological project is a public performance. Whenever archaeologists go about their archaeological work, they perform, at the very least, their own training and biases, their sources of funding and support, and the history of their research subjects, a history to which they may have only the most tenuous connections."
1991,"Consumers, commodities, and choices: A general model of consumer behavior","Results of present-day marketing and consumer behavior research suggest that consumer decision-making processes and commodity acquisition patterns differ depending upon a number of variables, including identity of the decisionmakers, nature and type of commodity, perceived need for an item, and the socio-cultural environment. Archaeological research tends to focus on aspects of historical consumer behavior associated with specific commodities and exhibited by particular segments of the population. It is suggested that a general model of consumer behavior, one not linked to any specific commodity or population segment, will serve to place archaeological research in a broader context and permit the future development of consumer behavior models for other types of commodities and population segments."
1991,"House and barn; the wealth of farmers, 1795–1815","Analysis of 511 probate inventories from northwestern New Jersey in the period 1795–1815 forms the context within which to interpret the farm and household of Thomas Hamlin, a substantial farmer who died in 1810. Comparison of his standing in the community, based on church records and property, with the type of household goods indicates that he lived in a modestly comfortable fashion, which did not differ substantially from the life-styles of his neighbors. Having achieved a threshold of comfort, marked by beds and coarse tablewares, prosperous farmers like Thomas Hamlin seem to have chosen to invest in land and livestock as well as in enlarging the dwelling. Comparison of household goods with goods for sale in local stores, however, indicates that costume and augmentations to diet were significant consumer commodities that are not reflected in probate inventories, which, like tableware, are reflective of durable— as opposed to nondurable—consumer goods."
1991,Historical dimensions of consumer research,"Consumer behavior has been widely studied within the social sciences, and there is a diverse body of empirical data and theory available. A brief review of the literature shows clearly that expenditures for food constituted the dominant element in the budgets of the poor and working class pre-industrial households. The relative amount spent for food has been used within the social sciences as an indicator of a household’s economic well-being, with more wealthy households allocating a lower proportion of their budgets for food. Archaeological techniques are well suited to the study of foodways, and foodways is the area where archaeologists have contributed significantly to an understanding of historical consumption patterns. The analytical techniques currently used by archaeologists are best suited for simple description and identification. As a whole, archaeologists have not produced successful comparative studies, partially because of a lack of standard analytical techniques among different researchers, but also because of a lack of historical context and sound theoretical models. It is argued that archaeologists need to utilize concepts that have been proven useful by economists, sociologists, and historians, so that findings will have broader significance within the social sciences."
1991,"Plants, humans, and culture: An edible model of consuming behavior","Botanicals are often present in abundant quantities in historic sites, so it is important to exploit the interpretive potential of these data. Understanding how a household chooses and prepares plants to consume, medicate, intoxicate, and beautify can give insight into how that household makes consumer choices. The model presented here lays the analytical framework by which floral data can be fully integrated into historical archaeology. The model accommodates the uniqueness of floral data because the variables which set parameters on consumer choices of plant products are not always the same as those for other classes of artifacts. The ultimate goal of the model is to provide linkages between botanical artifacts and consumer behavior that will be recognizable in the archaeological record."
1991,Faunal remains and consumer behavior: What is being measured?,"Although historic sites faunal analyses are increasing in frequency and sophistication, it is difficult to compare many of these studies. Variables affecting acquisition and consumption need to be identified. Too often, inappropriate units of analysis are employed. A consumer behavior research framework, using the unit of acquisition as the basic analytical class, will clarify many of the variables that confront historic sites faunal analysis. It will yield less skewed results and facilitate comparative studies."
1991,Nineteenth-century ceramics and models of consumer behavior,"If one of the goals of historical archaeology is to describe and explain human behavior, and if the analysis of ceramics is to be a mechanism to achieve this goal, it is critical that researchers understand the historic context—i.e., the social and economic milieu—in which ceramics were produced, used, and discarded. In historical archaeology, these historic contexts, which can be summarized as testable models, are generally developed through historical research. This article examines a number of contexts on the purchase and use of 19th-century ceramics. Each context is summarized as a model, and is then evaluated in terms of its applicability to ceramic assemblages typically recovered from archaeological sites in the eastern United States."
1991,The post-civil war Battlefield Pattern: An example from the Custer Battlefield,Battlefield Pattern analyses define the spatial and temporal aspects of a battle. The pattern is made up of individual and unit behaviors. Battlefield Pattern analyses test hypotheses regarding the progress of a battle. Gross patterns are defined as the spatial aspect of behavior. Dynamic patterns are defined as analytical techniques that can identify participant movement. Recent historical archaeological investigations at Custer Battlefield National Monument illustrate this process. Battlefield Pattern analyses provide an initial step in defining the archaeological aspect of warfare within broader anthropological contexts.
1991,A revised set of CC index values for Classification and Economic Scaling of english ceramics from 1787 to 1880,"This paper presents an updated and expanded set of CC index values for plates, teas, and bowls for the period 1787 to 1880. It is meant to replace the index values in the article “Classification and Economic Scaling of 19th-century Ceramics” (Miller 1980). In addition to expanding the range of years covered, it adds values for dishes and for Irish size teas, as well as correcting a misconception about the stability of the price of CC ware during the first half of the 19th century. A better understanding of the discount rates has made it necessary to recalculate the index values for the post-1844 period. This paper also presents extensive chronological and descriptive information on the common types of ceramics that were imported from the 1780s to the 1880s."
1991,"Economic means index: A measure of social status in the chesapeake, 1690–1815","In the past, efforts by archaeologists to establish an individual’s social status from the surviving, often fragmentary documentary record tended to suffer from unstated assumptions about the relationships between social status and wealth, as well as from the lack of any specified standard of comparison and comparable monetary units. This paper offers a way that may avoid this situation. Social status is defined, and a method for its measure is proposed, based on the economic means for social success in the Chesapeake from 1690–1815. Economic variables include land, bound labor, cattle, and horses. A standard of comparison is formulated from the average economic means of the 100 wealthiest Virginians listed in the 1787–1788 state tax records (Main 1954). Formulas for deriving the comparative status value (CSV) for each economic variable—land, bound labor, cattle, and horses—pertinent to a given individual are provided and from them are calculated an individual’s Economic Means Index (EMI). Several examples of CSV and EMI use are described, their probable limits are noted, and suggestions for their further refinement are offered."
1991,"Who’s been workin’ on the railroad?: An examination of the construction, distribution, and ethnic origins of domed rock ovens on railroad-related sites","In recent years small domed rock structures have been recorded throughout western North America; others are located in Australia. Those that occur on railroad-related sites are mainly associated with railroad construction camps; a few are known to have been built by later section gang workers. Still others have been found in mining regions, particularly in California. While folklore has often referred to them as “Chinese ovens,” no archaeological or documentary evidence has yet been found that would definitely support a Chinese association with either their manufacture or use in the United States. Instead, there is reason to believe that they were built and used mainly by Italian immigrants who brought with them a familiarity with the construction and use of such ovens for baking bread. In Canada and Australia, however, domed rock structures have occasionally been found on sites apparently coinciding with Chinese occupation. This paper surveys rock oven construction techniques, distribution, ethnic associations, dating, and related literature; it provides a starting point for more intensive, localized studies of such structures."
1991,Arms from Addison Plantation and the Maryland militia on the Potomac frontier,"Recent excavations at the Addison Plantation site (18 PR 175) resulted in the recovery of an assemblage of flintlock mechanisms and firearms hardware from several early 18th-century components. These materials were part of an armory maintained by Thomas Addison in conjunction with his duties as a colonel in command of the Prince George’s County militia. Analysis of this assemblage in the context of Addison family history and the early 18th-century history of the Potomac region provides insights into the duties of provincial militia officers and the evolving role of the militia on the Potomac frontier. Based on this analysis, the militia’s development from the early 17th century through the mid-18th century may be divided into two distinct periods: 1622–ca.l714, when the militia was very active as the primary defense of the frontier; and ca. 1715–1764, a period of decline during which the Prince George’s County militia was utilized primarily to prevent insurrection and to recapture runaway slaves."
1991,Faience in French colonial Illinois,"Faience, a tin-glazed earthenware, has been recovered at many colonial-period archaeological sites in North America. Intersite analysis towards recognition of ceramic patterning has been impeded by the lack of a standard classificatory typology for faience vessel fragments. Such a classification system is offered in this paper and summary data are presented for the faience assemblages from eight Illinois sites, including French forts and domestic settlements and related Illini villages. Interpretations are offered concerning the availability, utilization, and social role of faience in the Illinois Country during the French colonial period."
1991,A reconstruction of 19th-century surgical techniques: Bones in Dr. Thompson’s Privy,"Archaeological excavation of a later 19th-century doctor’s privy in Annapolis, Maryland, yielded portions of two adult femora and one subadult hand bone. The femora have surgical cuts at both the proximal and distal ends, suggesting postmortem anatomical experimentation. The bones offer insight into behaviors and surgical practices of 19th-century physicians. These specimens are an example of an unusual placement in an historic site."
1990,"Fur trade era blacksmith shops at Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site, North Dakota","Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site, North Dakota, represents the major outpost of the American Fur Company on the Upper Missouri between 1829 and 1867. Seven seasons of archaeological excavations conducted at the site for the purpose of obtaining structural information about the fort prior to reconstruction produced a variety of blacksmithing tools and features. Historical and field data indicate that four different locations were occupied by the blacksmith shops during the fort’s existence. The present discussion is concerned with the structural layout and associated artifacts recovered from the 1850s blacksmith shop and the final smithy, built by the U.S. Army in 1864."
1990,Minimum vessel lists as evidence of change in folk and courtly traditions of food use,"This paper discusses one segment of an empirical study of pottery and porcelain vessels from Cheasapeake sites, with comparanda from English and New England sites. The focus is whether in defining recursive relations between objects and social status during an era of rapid change, small shifts are visible in archaeological data that can be used to plot the process whereby change touched different sectors of society. The data source is minimum vessel lists. Comparable information in probate inventories for early 18th-century Annapolis merchants is integrated into the discussion. Note was made of vessel form, ware type, dominant color, and decoration. Vessels were classified according to their primary use in the food domain which was itself divided into five different phases. The argument presented suggests that it is the social context, i.e., the relationship between two food domains: (a) food prepared in a folk tradition, and (b) that prepared as part of elite cuisine, that structures the acquisition of ceramic vessels by Maryland families and their subsequent discard on archaeological sites."
1990,"The historical archaeology of mortuary behavior: Coffin hardware from Uxbridge, Massachusetts","A popular cultural trend developed in late 18th- and 19th-century American mortuary practices. Called “the beautification of death,” this Romantic movement idealized death and heaven through ideological, behavioral, and material transformations. The appearance of mass-produced Coffin hardware in archaeological contexts throughout North America may be linked with this popular movement. Archaeological recovery of mass-produced coffin hardware and glass view plates, from cemeteries spanning a range of socioeconomic contexts, demonstrates that certain aspects of popular culture were so pervasive as to find expression, albeit dilute, at even the lowest level of society. The presence of decorated coffins at the Uxbridge Almshouse Burial Ground, as at other cemeteries associated with socioeconomically marginal groups, also suggests that archaeological interpretations that unquestioningly equate socioeconomic status directly to coffin embellishment need to be reviewed in light of socio-historical developments relating to mass consumption and popular culture in industrializing America."
1990,"Site formation processes at Fort Fillmore, New Mexico: First interpretations","While the general, theoretical level of analysis is of great interest among historical archaeologists, it remains critical to address certain basic, methodological issues. This point is illustrated with an example from Fort Fillmore, New Mexico, a Civil War period frontier military outpost. Initial artifact analysis suggested that more locally-produced ceramic vessels were present near the officers’ quarters, relative to what was present near the enlisted men’s barracks. Further analysis, however, taking into account site formation processes, suggested a very different picture—a relatively greater number of locally-produced ceramic vessels might actually have been present at the latter location. Which interpretation is correct cannot be resolved at present, and historical scenarios regarding the military use of local goods are judged primarily by reference to documentary evidence."
1990,Electrical resistivity surveys in two historical cemeteries in Northeast Texas: A method for delineating unidentified burial shafts,"Electrical resistivity surveys have been conducted in two historical cemeteries in northeast Texas. The purpose of the work was to establish an empirical test of the resistivity method in identifying known graves in the I.D. Parker Cemetery in Hurst, Texas, and to apply the method in locating unknown burial shafts in a small south Dallas cemetery where markers had been destroyed. Resistivity surveys in the Parker Cemetery were successful in distinguishing known graves when a uniform electrode spacing of 0.5 m was employed. At the south Dallas cemetery, initial excavations at marked graves prior to the resistivity survey located some burials, but it was not clear that all remains had been recovered from the site. As a test to see if undiscovered burials remained, a resistivity data grid with 0.5 m electrode spacing was developed for the cemetery. Eight anomalies, interpreted as potential burial shafts, were identified; six were deemed optimum. Excavation of all eight anomalies located four sets of human remains. The results of these surveys indicate that the method can be effective in identifying unknown burial shafts."
1990,Tree-ring studies of the Pueblo de Acoma,"Core sampling in 1987 and 1988 provided construction dates for approximately 50 rooms of the original 17th-century portion of Acoma pueblo. Building commenced with the north row in A.D. 1646 and proceeded to the south and upward. Evidence from the topmost levels suggests that the pueblo achieved its present form by A.D. 1652. The regularity in size, number, and placement of vigas parallels the architectural uniformity of the rooms and houses. Comparison with plans of the village drawn in 1934 shows substantial remodeling, especially to the fronts of the houseblocks, and infilling of streets and plazas. The unusual uniformity of Acoma architecture is discussed, and differences between Acoma and Walpi Pueblo are noted."
1990,"Tabasco brand pepper sauce bottles from Avery Island, Louisiana","Archaeologists investigating sites inhabited after 1868 often find bottles that once contained Tabasco brand pepper sauce, manufactured by McIlhenny Company, Avery Island, Louisiana. Detailed information about these bottles is difficult to obtain from the literature. Archaeological research on Avery Island has provided relative dating information about these bottles that will be of interest to historical archaeologists."
1990,Other questions that count: Introductory comments on assessing significance in historical archaeology,"It may be observed that the treatment of historic sites in federally-mandated historic preservation programs does not do justice to those resources. Indeed, the review and compliance procedure is inconsistent and at times capricious in dealing with archaeological sites of the Historic period. Accordingly, so that the intent and purpose of historic preservation legislation can be fully realized, affirmative steps must be taken to correct present deficiencies in the system."
1990,A regional perspective on assessing the significance of historic period sites,"Historic period archaeological sites are evaluated most frequently on the basis of the information potential of individual sites. This paper considers how the relative frequencies of different site types also can contribute to the understanding of regional patterns. Data from outer Cape Cod, Massachusetts, collected as part of the Cape Cod National Seashore Archaeological Survey are utilized."
1990,We’ve got thousands of these! What makes an historic farmstead significant?,"Farmstead sites are among the most ubiquitous Historic period sites on the North American continent, and more are identified daily in CRM studies. Therefore, it is ironic that the determination of their National Register significance, upon which hinges all efforts at preservation or substantial archaeological investigation, is still largely made on a case-by-case basis with only minimal effort to place individual sites in a regional context. This paper presents a possible approach to obtaining such context for considerable numbers of sites at an early stage of preservation planning, which has been found cost effective and replicable, involves data sources familiar to most researchers, and employs a stepped screening process to maximize the productivity of field efforts in significance determination."
1990,Site survey as a method for determining historic site significance,"Since 1977, the Tennessee Division of Archaeology has conducted a total of six major historical archaeological site survey projects. Types of surveys conducted include: thematic (archaeological sites only); cultural resource (archaeological sites, standing buildings, and other remains related to a common theme); state-owned areas (sites only); and representative county (sites only). Each of these survey types is discussed in terms of their contribution to the problem of determining historic site significance. Where applicable, thematic and cultural resource surveys have been found to produce good information for assessing individual site significance. For dealing with the problems caused by the vast numbers and diversity of Historic period resources, a county-as-community approach is offered as one means of assessing the importance of individual sites by viewing them within a conceptual model that is smaller than an entire state or region."
1990,Evaluating site significance in historical mining districts,"During the last several years, intensified mining of low grade ore deposits in the American West has created an explosion of CRM-related archaeological research. The evaluation of historic mining sites, however, has been plagued with a number of problems. Perhaps the most important is the lack of a coherent research design for assessing significance under National Register criterion (d). Other problem areas are related to scale, inventory, integrity, the lack of a comparative data base, and mining landscapes."
1990,Site significance and historical archaeology—A scenario and commentary,"Site significance is an issue that faces most archaeologists, often on a daily basis. The papers presented offer different means to assess site significance. Comments are offered on the papers and the different assessment approaches."
1990,A preliminary seriation of 19th-century decorated porcelain marbles,"Most of the children’s toy marbles found on 19th-century archaeological sites in America were originally imported from Germany. Although semiprecious stone and colorful handmade glass marbles were introduced by German toy makers in the latter half of the century, ceramic marbles, because they were relatively inexpensive, continued to be popular among young marble players. Starting in the 1850s and continuing until early into the first decade of the 20th century, toy makers fashioning ceramic marbles from porcelain decorated their products with hand-painted designs, including geometric patterns and flowers. Recently excavated finds indicate that the various design motifs seen on these marbles are potentially datable. After a general review of ceramic marble types, a classification of the design motifs seen on porcelain marbles is presented and their suggested date ranges are given."
1990,A question of inference: Interpretations of site abandonment behavior from survey data,"Surveys in anthropology are becoming much more common than in the past when participant-observation in ethnography and excavation in archaeology were the most common research methods employed. In archaeology there have been an increasing number of inferences drawn from site surface manifestations as the result of a growing survey data base. This paper discusses the reliability of such inferences and associated problems. It is suggested that excavation is necessary in some cases for more valid inferences to be drawn, particularly those related to mode of site abandonment. The article explores the issue from the perspective of catastrophic abandonment behavior, specifically the identification of historic Navajo ch’indi (ghost) hogans. The paper raises the question of what degree of reliability archaeologists are willing to be content with for inferences based on surface survey data."
1990,The origin of the Goleta cannons: Inferences of age based on various lines of evidence,"The origin of five iron cannons recovered in 1981 from a beach near Goleta on the southern California coast has been investigated by evaluating stylistic, archival, historical, metallurgical, and radiocarbon (14C) data. Particular attention has been focused on these cannons due to the suggestion advanced by previous writers that they were brought ashore by Sir Francis Drake in 1579. This proposed origin for the cannons would add another locality as the proposed site of Drake’s Nova Albion. The authors conclude that the weight of the evidence assigns a post-16th-century age to the Goleta cannons although the current physical evidence including the 14C data does not indicate whether they are 17th-, 18th- or 19th-century artifacts."
1990,Gunflints: A study,"A study of gunflints was undertaken to determine if a uniform use wear pattern is present on gunflints which would assist in the identification of small rectangular or sub-rectangular lithic artifacts from historic sites as gunflints. The study also sought better to understand how these patterns were formed. Both modern and archaeological specimens were employed in the study. Background information on the history, technology, and use of gunflints is summarized as a key to understanding the use wear patterns."
1990,In-house production of archaeological publications on the Macintosh,"Advances in graphics-oriented personal computers, software, and printers now make it possible for nearly anyone with a little practice to produce camera-ready, type-set quality materials for journals and books, permitting publication at greatly reduced cost. Many types of archaeological graphics, including maps, plans, and profiles, can easily be composed and integrated with text directly on the computer. While it is still most practical to prepare the mechanicals for certain fine drawings and photographic half-tones at least partially by hand, the process is greatly eased by modern page-layout software. The amount of paste-up necessary, even for a complex, profusely illustrated archaeological monograph, is minimal. Finally, inexpensive, dedicated software can reduce the time needed to prepare an index for a major monograph from about three weeks to three days, which should make this valuable feature a mandatory addition."
1990,Soils and settlement location in 18th century colonial Tidewater Virginia,"A case demonstrating the importance of soils as an attractive force in site location is constructed from a review of soil literature and agriculture practices. Since tobacco cultivation was the dominant economic activity in rural Tidewater Virginia, the environmental requirements of the tobacco plant heavily influenced the colonists’ site location decisions. Environmental and social factors, featuring the proximity of navigable water, roads, drinking water, nearest neighbor, and soil type were compared. The results confirmed the primacy of the role of soils in the decision of site location in a tobacco-based economy."
1990,Making cheese: Archaeology of a 19th century rural industry,"The concept of production strategies is employed to analyze the variety of organizational forms and technologies created by 19th century rural cheese makers. Archaeologically recovered data and historic documents are used to reconstruct the sequence of production strategies utilized at the Columbus Center Cheese Factory site in south-central New York State. Information on six changing aspects of plant operation is provided. These include ownership and management, marketing, materials procurement, manufacturing processes, expansion of production, and disposition of by-products."
1990,"Pottery and Pig’s Feet: Space, ethnicity, and neighborhood in Washington, D.C., 1880–1940","In the eyes of the social reformers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the migration of Afro-Americans from the rural former slave states to urban areas like Washington brought social problems. Modern scholars suggest that the behavior noted by the reformers was not deviant but the result of different cultural behavior based in the rural and ethnic experience of the Afro-Americans. In order to determine if there was a distinct ethnic culture among the Afro-Americans that lived in alleys, their material culture and household income strategies were compared to that of white households which were located on the street in a working class neighborhood. The comparisons determined that ethnic-based differences could be isolated while economic-based differences could not. This strengthens the conclusion that the Afro-Americans had distinctive behavior patterns that they were utilizing to adapt to the urban environment. It also suggests that where the economic variable can be controlled, differences based on ethnic behavior rather than on income will characterize archaeological assemblages from black households."
1990,"Pollen analysis and urban land use: The environs of Scottow’s Dock in 17th, 18th, and early 19th century Boston","Pollen analysis cannot be used to reconstruct the natural environment during the historical period in New England because Euroamerican land clearance and soil disturbance have biased the record. Land use is recorded among arboreal pollen counts, but the size of the affected pollen source area is difficult to ascertain. Close agreement among documentary, archaeological, and non-arboreal pollen records of land use within specific 17th through 19th century urban matrices and the contrasts between the pollen data from the contemporaneous, adjacent but functionally different Wilkinson Backlot and Bostonian Hotel Sites in Boston, Massachusetts, indicate that non-arboreal pollen spectra sensitively record vegetative response to different kinds of human activities across small horizontal and stratigraphic intervals. The minor pollen types are the most important; hence large sums must be tabulated if patterns of change are to be recognized. Pollen corrosion and concentration measures and arboreal/ non-arboreal pollen ratios contribute to the understanding of matrix deposition processes."
1990,“China Glaze” wares on sites from the American revolution: Pearlware before Wedgwood?,"Although 1783 has often been given as a date for the first appearance of significant amounts of pearlware in the United States, it has long been recognized that it appeared on British-occupied sites soon after its introduction by Wedgwood in 1779. Documentary evidence has recently been used to suggest that other potters were making an almost identical ware, called “china-glaze,” prior to Wedgwood’s production of “Pearl White.” This paper examines documentary and archaeological evidence for these early versions of pearlware on American sites, focusing on tightly dated contexts from the American Revolution. The research suggests an earlier inception date for pearlware, perhaps as early as 1774 or 1775. It also notes the implications this has for dating, for the understanding of the material world of soldiers, and for reconstructions of supply and long-distance trade during the Revolution."
1990,"Burned seeds from a gold rush store in Sacramento, California","More than 13,000 identifiable carbonized seeds and fragments were recovered from the charred remains of a Sacramento general store which burned in November, 1852. Thirteen species of plants are represented in the collection, including three kinds of grain, two wild grasses, and eight food and spice plants. The seed assemblage illustrates several topics related to gold rush merchandising, frontier diets, and mid-19th-century commercial agriculture."
1989,The role of pewter as missing artifact: Consumer attitudes toward tablewares in late 18th century Virginia,"Ceramic assemblages have long been scrutinized by archaeologists. Yet, remarkably little attention has been given to food-related objects not found in the archaeological record. This study assesses the role of pewter—one such “missing artifact”—as an alternative and companion to ceramics, and thus provides a documentary framework of consumer choice amidst social and marketing pressures. Probate inventories of Albemarle County, Virginia, from 1770 to 1799 reveal a nearly standard presence of pewter in households of varying economic levels even after the introduction of the “fashionable” creamware, and the slow addition of ceramics to—not substitution for—pewter in more wealthy households. Comparing pewter and creamware purchases at contemporary retail stores estimates the time between an object’s purchase and its recording in the probate process, and demonstrates real regional variability and rural conservatism. Finally, a consumer’s view of pewter is attempted through an understanding of its economic and symbolic value and its uses within a household."
1989,On plantations and patterns,"South’s pattern concept has acquired prominence in archaeological research since its explanation in the late 1970s. Nowhere has this prominence been greater than in plantation archaeology. Unfortunately, the pattern concept is inappropriate for the analysis of plantation remains because its scope is too large and its perspective is mainly synchronic."
1989,"The Spanish colonial wineries of Moquegua, Peru","The Moquegua Bodegas Project is an ongoing archaeological and historical research project focused on the bodegas (wineries) established by Spanish colonial settlers in the Moquegua valley of far southern Peru. During two seasons of survey, 130 bodega locations were identified in this small valley, testifying to the economic importance of wine and brandy production, chiefly for transport to the mining areas of “Upper Peru.” The 1987 season included shovel testing at 27 sites, mapping of the adobe ruins of 20 bodegas, and excavations at one bodega, Locumbilla, which confirmed an early 17th century date for the site and yielded evidence of a buried kiln. Continuing excavations are planned for Locumbilla and additional bodegas."
1989,What mean these seeds: A comparative approach to archaeological seed analysis,"Since uncharred seeds recovered from archaeological deposits may be modern intrusions, researchers must evaluate each uncharred seed assemblage before assigning archaeological significance to it. When depositional circumstances are established, seed remains can yield primary data about diet, farming practices, and the spread of imported cultigens. Three uncharred seed assemblages are evaluated— one from Morven (Princeton, New Jersey) and two from the Calvert site (Annapolis, Maryland). The Morven seeds are modern. Seeds from a dry crawl space at the Calvert site probably date to the late 18th century, but rodent disturbance could have introduced more recent materials. Waterlogged seeds from a sealed 18th century well most securely reflect 18th century debris."
1989,Wealth and status in the upper South socioeconomic system of Northeastern Missouri,"Historical-period settlement of the central Salt River valley of northeastern Missouri began in 1819, and by 1825 the region was regularly receiving immigrant agriculturists, many of whom were from the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. Colonists brought with them basic elements of what has been termed the upper South agricultural-economic pattern—a mix of hog and corn production practiced by small-scale farmers and cattle and tobacco production practiced by large-scale agriculturists. These transplanted elements became the foundation for social and economic development of the Salt River valley for decades. Immigrant families often moved to the region as parts of large kin-based networks that maintained geographic integrity by purchasing clustered tracts of land. Several lines of documentary evidence indicate considerable homogeneity in wealth existed among families within a settlement cluster and significant differences in wealth existed between clusters. Additional evidence of intracluster homogeneity in wealth is provided by ceramic items discarded by households of similar economic rank, though it is unclear how useful ceramics are in differentiating among households of unequal rank. Consumer profiles indicate households of medium wealth purchased a wide assortment of ceramic items, including porcelain and expensive white-bodied wares. They also constructed elaborate residences that apparently served as visible signs of prosperity."
1989,"A good man in Israel: Zooarchaeology and assimilation in Antebellum Washington, Washington, Arkansas","Recovery of faunal remains in a rich deposit of household trash in Washington, Arkansas, presented an opportunity to examine ethnicity in the archaeological record because the trash was discarded by the early 1840s by the Blocks, a prominent Jewish family. Analysis of the faunal collection suggests that Block foodways did not differ markedly from contemporaneous collections in urban settings. However, the ambiguity of ethnic signatures in this case record may provide clear evidence of cognitive uncertainty and assimilation, particularly since the documentary record suggests continued identification by some family members with Judaism."
1989,Artifact illustration using computer videographs,"Artifact illustration is an essential part of any archaeological project. Previously, this was done using photographs or line drawings, but by using a videocamera interfaced with a graphics computer a new type of illustration, a videograph, is produced, combining photographic details with the ability to modify and enhance the resultant image."
1989,The emergent elite in early 18th century Portsmouth society: The archaeology of the Joseph Sherburne houselot,"This paper examines the occupation of the Sherburne house at Strawbery Banke by Joseph Sherburne—a wealthy and influential merchant and politician in 18th century Portsmouth, New Hampshire. An analysis based on archival, architectural, archaeological, and horticultural research reveals how Sherburne used his house, property, furnishings, dress, diet, and slaves to ensure and reinforce his social and political relationships."
1989,The Lowell Boott Mills complex and its housing: Material expressions of corporate ideology,"Lowell, Massachusetts, the first planned industrial city in New England, was a total departure from earlier forms of urban life in North America. This essay examines the ways in which the ideology of industrial capitalism and the policy of corporate paternalism are reflected in the built environment of 19th century Lowell. Using the Boott Cotton Mills Corporation as a case study, the ways in which corporate policies regulated and permeated the material lives of workers on the job and at home are considered. The analysis draws upon an interdisciplinary body of data but emphasizes the ways in which archaeological investigations can illuminate the contrast between the stated company policy of concern for workers’ welfare and the reality of workers’ living conditions."
1989,“Utility and beauty should be one:” The landscape of Jack London’s ranch of good intentions,"Jack London—popular author, avid traveler, and vocal socialist—left two legacies to the world: his writings and his Beauty Ranch. This paper examines the common principles influencing London’s self-expression in writing and across the landscape."
1989,Pattern and process in the plantation archaeology of the lowcountry of Georgia and South Carolina,"Considerable archaeological research has been conducted on plantations in Georgia and South Carolina’s lowcountry since James Ford’s (1937) pioneering efforts in the 1930s. This work offers perhaps the most comprehensive body of data related to a particular cultural entity yet to be developed in historical archaeology and hence the opportunity to address problems in archaeological method and theory. This paper presents an interpretation of the problems and potential of artifact patterning (South 1977), as it applies to plantation archaeology. It is argued that patterning is determined by a number of factors, including excavation strategy and cultural processes, and that a more critical application of patterning is called for if the concept is to be successfully employed. The variation between the Georgia and Carolina Slave Artifact patterns is discussed in terms of architecture, ethnicity and status, and technological innovations, all of which are considered as potentially influencing the appearance of distinctive Georgia and Carolina slave patterns. Patterning is viewed as a useful organizational tool but one which requires a more critical application if its comparative research value is to be accurately assessed and positively employed."
1989,Status and ceramics for planters and slaves on three Georgia coastal plantations,"Previous work on Georgia plantations has provided useful data about life on the large plantations on barrier islands. More recent work on small to mid-sized plantations reveals that slaves’ acquisition of ceramics may reflect more of their own decisions on what was purchased and what was used. Coarser ware frequencies indicate food preparation and storage in the slave quarters. Porcelain was often found in greater numbers in the slave quarters than in the plantation bighouse kitchen. Like earlier research, slaves at Kings Bay were found to have relatively more small bowls, but surprisingly they had relatively more plates as well. Comparison of slaves and planters using CC Index revealed that for several vessel forms the slaves had more expensive ceramics than their masters. This suggests that the slaves themselves viewed ceramics as status indicators and purchased them accordingly."
1989,"Function, meaning and context: Ambiguities in ceramic use by the hivernant Metis of the northwestern plains","The 19th century hivernant Metis of the northwestern Canadian plains and parklands followed a way of life centered on communal bison hunting and frequent mobility. Contrary to what might be expected, excavations at five hivernant wintering sites consistently have recovered a variety of fragile, transfer printed, earthenware ceramics. In this context, ceramics, as a form of material culture, are seen to incorporate an ambiguity in function and meaning. In exploring this ambiguity, it is suggested that Metis ceramic use originates with an initial concern for female status and etiquette in Red River fur trade society. Ultimately, ceramics are argued to have assumed a much greater symbolic role. This role was integral in hivernant Metis social interaction and integration."
1989,Xeroradiography of historic ceramics: Four New England Kilns,"An apparent conundrum facing historical archaeologists is the practical inability to distinguish meaningful analytical groupings between fragmentary pieces of earthenware at a reasonable cost. Excavators retrieve thousands of earthenware body sherds from field projects, yet most of these sherds are of limited research value in subsequent analysis because they all look alike. Xeroradiography is a radiographic technique which, when applied to non-lead-glazed earthenware, allows the analyst to separate these sherds in an objective manner based on the inclusions found within the bodies of the wares. It is suggested that xeroradiography could be part of a sound and cost-efficient approach to ware separation and identification. Such a program would include sampling for and examination by heavy mineral analysis and petrology. A feasibility study utilizing a known but intentionally mixed sample from four different kiln sites successfully segregated the wares of each kiln."
1989,Zooarchaeological measures revisited,"Recent studies explore the derivation of social and economic information from zooarchaeological data. The most recently defined variable, cost-efficiency, was miscalculated by Lyman (1987). Calculated correctly, the variable does clarify information concerning purchasing behavior and suggests additional methodological refinements."
1988,"The interpretation of 17th century sites through plow zone surface collections: Examples from St. Mary’s City, Maryland","Many 17th century sites in the Chesapeake have undergone surface disturbance from agriculture or other causes. Despite the disturbance, these surface layers contain vitally important data on site age, layout, and abandonment. Agricultural disturbance must be viewed as a transformation that can be studied and controlled. This paper explores the effects of agriculture on sites and presents several examples of the quality of cultural patterning data that can be derived from plowed surfaces. It argues that this data is essential for a full interpretation of any 17th century site."
1988,"A comparative midden analysis of a household and inn in St. Mary’s City, Maryland","This paper investigates the nature of functional variation as reflected on an intra-site level. Although a site generally has one “function,” most sites contain material evidence of numerous activities occurring at different times and places among different groups of people. Distributions and associations of archaeological materials are analyzed using data derived from the St. John’s site, an early 17th century tobacco plantation which later served as an inn, adjacent to St. Mary’s City. Variation between the Household and the Inn phases of occupation is described, and variation in the locations of activities at the site is demonstrated. However, differences between the Household and Inn occupations appear more subtle and may be due to a number of factors as well as functional variation. The analysis demonstrates the need for more studies of a similar type in order to address differences in function and differences among site occupants."
1988,"Spatial analysis of the King’s Reach plantation homelot, ca. 1690–1715","This paper considers the spatial arrangement and utilization of the King’s Reach plantation homelot (ca. 1690–1715). The primary analytical tool is the interpretation of distributional patterns of plowzone-derived artifacts. The pipe stem distributions have proven to be especially effective in identifying diachronic shifts in refuse disposal. The ceramics, glass, and other materials are not particularly indicative of temporal change, but do provide evidence for functional differentiation. Those patterns point to a typically located and oriented plantation house and quarter, with extensive refuse middens nearby. However, the King’s Reach homelot appears unusual in that other outbuildings, almost always found at such sites, have not been discovered. Their absence may be at least partially explained by the presence of a possible outlying quarter and/or workhouse located nearby. An unusual number of cellars were located below the plantation house floor, apparently a result of successive replacement due to collapsing cellar walls."
1988,Baroque cities in the wilderness: Archaeology and Urban development in the colonial Chesapeake,"Historians have long assumed that Maryland’s 17th century capital was an unplanned, scattered village with little urban character. In this paper, new archaeological evidence is presented which demonstrates that St. Mary’s City was actually an elaborately planned settlement, laid out according to principles of Baroque design. This is the earliest known use of Baroque urban planning in America. Comparison of the St. Mary’s layout with that of other colonial cities reveals that these Baroque urban concepts were only employed in the Chesapeake region. Possible reasons for this unusual distribution are presented and the implications of this finding regarding the relationship between society, economy, settlement system and urban form are discussed."
1988,"“The bare necessities:” Standards of living in England and the Chesapeake, 1650–1700","The domestic environment had a profound influence on the texture of everyday life in early modern England and America not only in terms of family interaction but also as a tangible reflection of broader social attitudes towards hierarchy, status and consumerism. This article compares standards of living in England and the Chesapeake between 1650 and 1700. Three regions are analyzed in detail: the Vale of Berkeley, Gloucestershire; St. Mary’s County, Maryland; and part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. It is argued that a comparison of material culture and living standards reveals important aspects of the advantages and disadvantages of emigrating from England to the Chesapeake, and suggests significant differences between the two societies in this period."
1988,Neither history nor prehistory: the Questions that count in historical archaeology,"Historical archaeology’s singular and unique strength among the social sciences is its simultaneous access to multiple categories of evidence bearing upon the same processes or events in past human behavior (either immediately or remotely in the past). Although this has been obvious for nearly two decades, historical archaeology has not produced the original and unparalleled insights into human cultural behavior or evolution that we might expect to result from the unique perspective and data base of the field. We have instead tended to weakly reproduce or “test” insights and principles resulting from history or prehistoric archaeology. Both the questions we have asked and the methods we have used to answer them have been grounded in fields other than historical archaeology and have generally ignored its special perspective."
1988,"Questions of substance, questions that count","Historical archaeology, while amassing a large body of data, is currently proceeding without benefit of organizing theory. As a consequence, both methodology and data synthesis have suffered, often leading to the testing of hypotheses with the same data used to form them. The result of over 20 years of research is a mixed bag of contributions, ranging from obvious answers to naive and self-evident questions to the testing of hypotheses concerning complex intersite relationships and cultural dynamics. In this paper I examine both the strengths and weaknesses of the discipline, and I provide examples of studies dealing with questions of substance. Finally, specific suggestions for future research are offered."
1988,Historical archaeology as anthropology,"The title of this paper is not meant as the trumpet fanfare for a new debate over whether historical archaeology should be history or anthropology. Its purpose is to suggest that historical archaeology can be more than a social history that relies upon material culture as one of its primary sources of data. We need to ask historically important questions, but we should also emphasize the comparative approach employed in anthropology and focus on those topics that have cross-cultural applicability over both time and space. Two major problem domains are outlined: world urbanization and environmental history. Subsidiary topics, including the impact urbanization has had on the work of both men and women are also addressed. These topics are well suited for investigation by historical archaeologists, assuming that we expand our repertoire of methods. With the latter point in mind the importance of a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach is discussed within the context of our two problem domains. It is argued that both world urbanization and environmental history are topics involving socially and politically significant questions to which historical archaeology can make important contributions."
1988,Whither pattern?,"Although the search for patterning in the archaeological record has become a major focus in historical archaeology, pattern recognition as it is practiced today normally does not extend beyond particularistic, inductivistic exercises in identification and labelling. The failure of historical archaeologists to realize the potential of the pattern recognition approach is due to the nearly total absence of links connecting the patterns and the past cultural processes responsible for them. Energy theory provides fertile ground for generating research questions concerning cultural process, but if we are to meaningfully interpret the process behind the pattern, arguments of relevance connecting class distinctions to the control of energy resources must be developed. In my opinion the quantitative expression, in terms of energy theory, of such archaeologically based socioeconomic status-level studies represents a major challenge for the future."
1988,"The relationship between archaeological data and the documentary record: 18th century gardens in Annapolis, Maryland","Archaeological and documentary sources on three 18th century formal gardens in Annapolis, Maryland, are compared against each other in order to outline a method for knowing the past through historical archaeology. The suggested method is analogous to middle range theory."
1988,"Archaeological remains, documents, and anthropology: a call for a New culture history","Historical archaeology is either a significant or superfluous endeavor, depending on the level one stands on to critique the discipline. If theoretical questions concerning the nature, dynamics and evolution of cultures are the starting point, or equally if more substantive but similarly broad questions of modern “world systems” are selected, then the results of a quarter century of excavations on historic sites are indeed weak and unconvincing. In contrast, a view grounded on “culture history” or “historic ethnography” finds historical archaeology to be potentially an impressive, productive field, equal in many ways to other data sources including written records. It is suggested that “historic ethnography,” based equally on archaeology and written sources, is the future natural sphere for the archaeological investigations of the modern world (A.D. 1400–20th century)."
1988,A reassessment of the chronological and typological framework of the spanish Olive Jar,"Bound for New Spain in 1724, the Conde de Tolosa and the Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe sank on the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic during a hurricane. Recent salvage of the two wrecks was undertaken by Caribe Salvage. Among the items recovered were over 600 complete Olive Jars. Employed as a main type of shipping container by the Spanish during their exploration and colonization of the Americas, the Olive Jar, with its various forms, has been shown by recent studies to be a temporal indicator."
1988,Glass bead sites in amsterdam,"A review of documentary sources and recent archaeological discoveries provide a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of glass bead production in Amsterdam. Evidence now indicates that bead making probably began during the late 16th century and continued well into the 18th. Because several of the recovered bead assemblages can be dated with precision, they provide a basis for comparative studies with glass beads from both the New World and other post-medieval sites in Europe."
1988,"17th century apalachee colono-ware as a reflection of demography, economics, and acculturation","Pottery termed Colono-Ware was produced by both Indians and Black slaves in the Spanish and British North American colonies. Examples from Apalachee Province of Spanish Florida are very different from those made in the southeastern British colonies or in 16th century Hispaniola. This paper suggests that the varieties of Colono-Ware found in these different colonial contexts reflect local demographic, economic, and acculturative conditions. The European country of origin for the colony also seems to play a role in Colono-Ware design."
1988,"The clay pipes from green spring plantation (44JC9), Virginia","Little descriptive material concerning clay tobacco pipes from circa 1650–1700 era Tidewater plantations has been published. This report presents formal analysis and description of the clay tobacco pipes recovered during 1954–55 excavations at Green Spring Plantation in James City County, Virginia. Two important characteristics of the assemblage emerge from the study. First, a high proportion of the pipe fragments are Dutch in origin, indicating a substantial degree of economic interaction between Tidewater Virginia and the Netherlands, at least in the limited sphere of the clay pipe trade. Second, an apparently well-developed terra-cotta pipe manufacturing capacity existed, possibly at Green Spring itself. This portion of the assemblage includes decorative design elements wholly different from those displayed on English or Dutch pipes."
1987,"A survey of domestic reform movement sites in Boston and Cambridge, Ca. 1865–1905","This research is concerned with identifying site types connected with socio-political movements directed at improving women’s status by shifting women’s gender roles from the domestic to the public sphere. This survey is specifically concerned with potential archaeological contributions to our knowledge of women’s domestic reform movements in 19th century Boston and Cambridge. Domestic reform movements are particularly appropriate for archaeological research because they attempted to raise women’s status by altering the material culture conditions supporting the continuation of women’s work in the private domestic sphere, in a subordinate position to men’s work in the public sphere. Domestic movements tried to achieve women’s equality by transforming housework from private unremunerated labor into marketable professional wage labor comparable to men’s skilled occupations. A site survey has been undertaken to archaeologically assess the impacts of domestic reform movements on the historic use of urban space, by measuring the quantity, variety, and distribution of sites associated with these movements. This survey was undertaken to address three questions. First, what new site types were 1) generated by and 2) survive from these domestic movements? Second, what can be learned about the scale and impacts of housekeeping movements from their site type distribution patterns? Third, some suggestions are made for archaeological identification of domestic reform site types and ways that archaeological data could contribute to our understanding of how these movements changed participants’ lifeways."
1987,"The view from the midden: An analysis of midden distribution and composition at the van sweringen site, St. Mary’s City, Maryland","Most intrasite spatial studies in historical archaeology have focused on the horizontal distributions of artifacts with only minimal attention given to the associations of materials found in midden contexts. In this paper the distribution and composition of plowed midden deposits from the van Sweringen site, a late 17th and early 18th century dwelling in St. Mary’s City, are investigated. Temporal changes in disposal patterns and midden composition, spatial variation among midden deposits, and the relationships between midden content and building function are presented. These findings demonstrate the potential of midden analysis and the importance of plow zone contexts for site interpretation."
1987,"Using dendrochronology for historical reconstruction in the Cortez Mining District, North Central Nevada","In 1863, the discovery of silver and gold ore at the north end of Grass Valley in central Nevada led to the formation of the Cortez Mining District. Immediately following this discovery, pinyon trees from the surrounding pinyon-juniper woodlands were impacted as a source of timber and fuel for mines, mills, and settlements. Tree-ring crossdating pinyon trees, tree stumps, and logs from historical archaeological sites provides a chronology for this tree’s use and the key for discerning the factors responsible for its varying use through time. The historic exploitation of pinyon coincided not only with their availability but also with developments in ore processing technology and changing economic factors. While severe deforestation is suggested by historic accounts and photographs, its intensity may have been less severe than some have suggested."
1987,An historical and archaeological evaluation of the CSS Georgia,"The CSS Georgia was a Confederate ironclad built in 1862 and deployed as part of the Savannah Squadron of the Confederate States Navy until December 1864. Intentionally sunk, the vessel has remained relatively intact except where damaged by harbor development activities. An archaeological and electronic instrumental survey of the wrecksite was begun in 1979 and continued at yearly intervals until 1984. The survey resulted in 1) the positive identification of the site as that of the CSS Georgia, 2) a distributional map of exposed features of the site, most notably the armored casemate, and 3) data to augment the paucity of historical information on the vessel’s specific dimensions. Other elements of the study were the analysis and conservation of recovered structural materials and artifacts."
1987,Ceramics and Commerce: The 1554 flota revisited,"The remains of the 1554 flota, commonly known as the Padre Island shipwrecks, are well known to historical archaeologists not only for the protracted court cases associated with one of the wrecks but for the high quality of archaeological and historic research conducted on them. This paper reevaluates the recovered ceramic materials in light of the past decade’s ongoing research in this area of Hispanic 16th century material culture. This information is utilized to pose future research questions and to suggest how submerged and terrestrial site evidence can be integrated to afford a more holistic view of the dynamic Spanish world-system whose static remains are the essence of archaeological study."
1987,"Aspects of early Afro-American material culture: Artifacts from the slave quarters at Garrison Plantation, Maryland","The 1964–65 excavation of the slave quarters at Garrison Plantation near Baltimore, Maryland, yielded groups of objects that display certain ‘Africanisms.’ The groups of objects are proposed elements of early Afro-American material culture and are compared to items from similar sites in the mid-Atlantic region."
1987,Burials from the Santa Barbara Presidio chapel,"Nearly twenty years ago, three burials were excavated from the floor of the chapel at the site of El Real Presidio de Santa Barbara, California. Two of the graves contained only sparse remains while Burial #3 consisted of the nearly complete skeleton of a young woman and included fragments of material and ornaments from her clothing. Osteological analysis, study of associated artifacts, and documentary research have resulted in tentative identification of two of the individuals and have provided information on the genetic affinities, health, burial practices, and clothing styles of this early 19th century Hispanic community."
1987,"Marine magnetometer survey of archaeological materials near Galveston, Texas","During June and the first week of July 1980, the Underwater Archeological Research Section of the Texas Antiquities Committee carried out a reconnaissance-level magnetometer survey of marine archaeological resources near Galveston, Texas. One purpose of the survey was to progress toward the agency’s long-term goal of examining the areas with the highest probability of yielding historic shipwrecks along the Texas coast and to protect the located sites from future disturbance. Another goal was to locate and, in future seasons, identify and assess for possible extensive excavation certain wrecks of historic significance known to lie in the area."
1987,"The ceramics collection from the Continental Army Cantonment at New Windsor, New York","Archaeological survey at the 1782–83 winter cantonment of the Continental Army at New Windsor, New York, has provided new evidence regarding the presence of blue hand-painted pearlware. Access to the various ceramic types was not dependent upon rank within the rigid formal hierarchy of this military encampment. In addition, the small size and low quantity of the ceramic collection reflects the success of the military practice of trash removal from the camp."
1987,On zooarchaeological Measures of socioeconomic position and cost-efficient meat purchases,"Recent zooarchaeological studies fail to explicitly define the concept of “socioeconomic position,” yet assume the varied costs of different beef cuts reflect such positions. While common-sensical, the concept of socioeconomic position seems so broadly conceived as to be of at best limited and at worst ambiguous explanatory value. Measures of edible meat yield as they relate to cost per pound tend to more clearly reflect cost-efficiency of meat purchases, and serve to clarify aspects of the income level of a group regardless of that group’s status."
1987,Second time around: A look at bottle reuse,"Until recently, glass bottles were generally used more than one time. This study investigates customs of bottle reuse in the United States during the 18th and 19th centuries, with particular attention to the secondhand bottle business and returnable bottle systems. Effects of bottle-manufacturing machinery and reasons for the decline of bottle reuse are discussed. The implications of reuse for the analysis of bottles from archaeological sites are considered."
1987,"Historic charcoal production near Eureka, Nevada: An archaeological perspective","Recent archaeological investigations conducted near Mt. Hope, located in central Nevada, resulted in the identification and evaluation of a wide variety of sites documenting the production of charcoal during the 1870–1890 silver mining boom at nearby Eureka. Present were remains of temporary surface ovens used to reduce wood to charcoal, habitation sites, and a number of small, nondescript work sites."
1987,"An unusual pipe stem find from St. Inigoes Manor, Maryland","During the spring of 1985, a preconstruction archaeological survey was conducted by the Maryland Historical Trust in a two-acre field known to have been a part of 17th century St. Inigoes Manor in lower St. Mary’s County, Maryland. As a result of the survey, two colonial tenant sites were identified, and two unusual and significant artifacts were recovered. The artifacts are two white clay tobacco pipe stem fragments with hand inscriptions that are believed to be the first such finds in Maryland and Virginia."
1986,Urban farmsteads: Household responsibilities in the city,"A focus of recent historical archaeological research in Arkansas is the nature of 19th century occupation in smaller population centers. The plats for many villages and towns permit examination of pattern and process at the least complex stratum of settlement: individual families and discrete house lots. The “urban farmstead” concept is defined and shows that until recently, such in-town lots contained buildings and spaces that functionally paralleled those of rural farmsteads. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of the model may be useful for examining residences in nucleated centers in other times and places. In many ways, the responsibility given to the occupants by the city for a variety of tasks, reflected in the urban farmstead, permitted nucleated settlement itself to continue."
1986,Measures of the acculturative response to trade on the central coast of British Columbia,"This study explores data from eight excavated sites on the Northwest Coast. All are Native settlements occupied during the historic period. The central focus is upon variation in the patterns of material cultural remains at these sites. From the perspective of the prehistorian the cultural change that occurred when Native and European cultures met was extremely rapid, too rapid to be investigated by using most of the standard techniques for archaeological dating. In 150 years a fully aboriginal material cultural inventory was replaced with one that is almost totally non-Native. This acculturative process was not random but patterned. With sufficient archaeological study the acculturative process may one day be seen as an understandable stage-by-stage process."
1986,Computer-correcting historical maps for archaeological use,"Although historical maps contain much cultural data that is of potential value to archaeologists, many early maps exhibit planometric distortions that make them difficult to use directly. A regression analysis procedure is proposed that will both evaluate the accuracy of historical maps and also geo-correct the cultural data on these maps. Using this procedure the positions of the cultural features that are shown on historical maps can be recalculated and plotted on modern base maps. A test case involving a late 19th century county atlas demonstrates the utility of the computer program that was employed for this purpose."
1986,The archaeology of historical land use in Massachusetts,"The ways in which a broadly conceived study of land use at historical homesites affects both methodological and theoretical approaches to the archaeology of the household are discussed. Special attention is given to ideological factors that resulted in manipulation of domestic landscapes as a means of social display; to the need for an archaeology that can provide a detailed chronological perspective on changing land use over time; and to the methods appropriate to such a study. An approach incorporating primary documentary research, social history, architectural history, and archaeological evidence in order to understand landscape alteration, waste and water management, and outbuilding construction as these relate to changes in household composition and economics is outlined. Examples from published studies and ongoing research are cited in order to illustrate the potential contributions of such an approach to the archaeology of domestic sites."
1986,Urban/rural contrasts in vertebrate fauna from the Southern Atlantic coastal plain,"A review of archaeological faunal data from urban and rural settings on the southern Atlantic coastal plain indicates that contrasts in these collections reflect the urban or non-urban setting of each site within this natural setting. These contrasts may be seen in the data despite probable differences in socioeconomic status of the sites’ occupants. Apparently, urban households consumed more meat from domestic animals than did rural households, regardless of social status. Rural faunal deposits are more diverse than urban ones and contained large amounts of fish instead of domestic animals. Data for this analysis are taken from 16 archaeological sites excavated at Charleston, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; St. Simons Island, Georgia; and elsewhere on the Georgia coast. The combined samples contained 1576 individuals from sites occupied between the mid-18th century and the mid-19th century."
1986,Of fish and sherds: A model for estimating vessel populations from minimal vessel counts,This paper presents a tentative model for estimating the total vessel population of a site by examining the vessels recovered from partial excavation. The model is aimed at providing measurable levels of confidence that can be placed on archaeological assemblages by establishing what percentage of available material was recovered.
1986,"Followup notes on the 17th century cod fishery at Damariscove Island, Maine","Exceptionally low tides in October 1985 revealed the stone footings of the 17th century fishing stages on Damariscove Island discussed in a recent article on the archaeology of the cod fishery. Photography shows two stage heads built of tabular granite and arranged side by side, part of a permanent fishing station which replaced the original seasonal facilities at the site. Such features can be taken as prima facie evidence of the development of the sedentary cod fishery, a settlement type characteristic of many sites on the coast of Maine."
1986,Soil chemistry and historic archaeological site activity areas: A test case from Northern Delaware,"Varied distributions of soil chemicals were compared to known activity areas at the Wilson-Slack site, a 19th century historic farmstead/blacksmith complex in northern Delaware. Calcium and magnesium were not clearly correlated with specific activity areas. Potassium and phosphorus were not correlated with animal penning areas but were correlated with a machine shop/blacksmithing area. Low pH values were correlated with organic-rich midden deposits."
1986,Historical archaeology in sub-Saharan Africa—A review,"Relatively few historical archaeology projects have been carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the area presents a wide variety of research potentialities from both historical and theoretical viewpoints. Various definitions of historical archaeology and their application to Africa are examined, and the research undertaken thus far is reviewed. Previous work has largely focused on the larger fortified sites of 15th to 19th century European construction. On the East African Coast archaeolological fieldwork has also been carried out on Islamic sites where limited documentation is provided by Arabic writings. Directions for future research are discussed, including the possibility of examining the socio—cultural background of the African diaspora. Particular stress is placed on the necessity for intensified regional studies, cognizant of the contacts between well documented historical sites and the villages and resource areas with which they interacted."
1986,Fur trade archaeology: A study of frontier hierarchies,"Zooarchaeological methods were used to examine status differences exhibited by two 19th century fur trading posts in northwestern Wisconsin (1802–1804). It was hypothesized that the well established North West Company Post would exhibit a higher standard of frontier living and hence, status, than that of the rival XY Company, and these differences should be reflected in the diet of the fur traders. Analysis indicates that the North West Company traders consumed a larger quantity and better quality of meat than their rivals. These data were also used, on an intrasite basis, to differentiate the occupants of the North West Company cabins. This examination yielded results which conflicted with previous interpretations, prompting a reexamination of the non-faunal data and rejection of the earlier interpretations."
1986,"Urban adaptation in Charleston, South Carolina, 1730–1820","Archaeologists studying urban areas have recently begun to investigate the adaptive strategies of city residents in an effort to determine how these may differ from those practiced by their rural counterparts. The authors of this article, an archaeologist and an historian, have applied a joint historical-archaeological approach to a study of adaptation in Charleston, South Carolina, during the years 1730 to 1820. Five main topics are addressed in this paper: site-specific spatial patterning, city-wide settlement patterning, artifact patterning, site formation processes, and subsistence strategies. A background of general historical information is given to create a framework within which specific archaeological sites are discussed in terms of their importance as indicators of archaeological manifestations of urban adaptive behavior in Charleston."
1986,"Domestic adaptation at Puerto Real, Haiti","Archaeological investigation of domestic adaptation at the 16th-century Spanish colony of Puerto Real is discussed. The results are compared to data from similar sites in St. Augustine, Florida. It is suggested that economic and environmental factors were prime movers in influencing the adaptive strategies revealed at the respective sites."
1986,"On the archaeology of early canals: Research on the Patowmack Canal in Great Falls, Virginia",The Patowmack Canal is an important artifact of early post-colonial development in the United States. Under construction in 1785 the canal system utilized the channel of the Potomac River in conjunction with five canals built to by-pass rapids and falls. This paper examines the historical context of this undertaking along with archaeological investigations at the Great Falls by-pass canal in Virginia. Archaeological excavations were employed to reveal the various technological elements of this first generation canal system. This technology is also shown to be a reflection of the institutional milieu which produced this artifact.
1986,Maintenance and fabrication at Fort Pentagoet 1635–1654 products of an Acadian armorer’s workshop,"From 1635 to 1654, Fort Pentagoet defended private commercial investments in Acadia against English enemies and French rivals. The extensive refuse associated with the armorer’s workshop shows evidence of highly diversified maintenance and fabrication covering a wide variety of technologies. Competence in complex forge related work is apparent, particularly in gunsmithing. Gunspalls were regularly and expertly made here although they were later replaced by ready-made blade-type gunflints. Requiring less sophistication was the salvage of scrap copper, brass and other materials, which were remanufactured into various makeshift everyday objects and trade items. The services provided by Pentagoet to the aboriginal population in support of the fur trade became crucial to Indian survival. The elimination of these services with the destruction of Fort Pentagoet in 1674 is suggested to have been a major factor in the spread of “King Philip’s War” to Maine in 1676."
1986,Documentation and identification of the two-masted schooner Neptune,"In late December 1982, remains of a wooden vessel were exposed by storm-induced winter beach erosion on the California coast near San Francisco. The environmentally exposed shipwreck remains were carefully documented, allowing a projected architectural reconstruction. Historical research provided a vessel-specific identification. The remains were identified as a starboard hull portion of the Neptune, a two-masted schooner involved in the lumber trade along the Pacific Coast from 1882 to 1900. Once common, the two-masted schooners of the Pacific Coast are now extinct; the documentation of Neptune’s wreckage was the first archaeological investigation of a vessel of this type. Now buried again by beach accretion, the remains provided the basis for a non-destructive maritime archaeological project that illustrates the maxim propounded by J. Richard Steffy (1977): “maximum results from minimum remains.” The documentation and identification of the Neptune is presented as a case study in approach and illustrates the significance of environmentally exposed wooden shipwreck remains."
1985,Commodity flows and national market access,"Commodity flows represent the pattern for manufactured goods reaching the customer. This article presents the application of a commodity flow model to data from archaeological sites in Mississippi, Washington, and New York, in order to relate those sites within a developing national market and transportation system."
1985,The recent fur trade in Northwestern Saskatchewan,"Archaeological survey in northwestern Saskatchewan identified sites ascribable to three resident ethnic/cultural groups: Chipewyan Indians, Cree/Metis Cree Indians and Euro-Canadians. Emphasis was placed on recording 19th and early 20th century sites, which are under-reported in the archaeological literature for the area. Archaeology, informant testimony and on-site interpretation of features, and ethnoarchaeological research on contemporary communities were combined to study ecological adaptations of the three populations and to define archaeological site formation processes. Each population adapted to the fur trade and to the other populations by filling specialized roles or occupations within the new mercantile system. Evidence for these different adaptations is discussed."
1985,Patterns of cultural behavior and intra-site distributions of faunal remains at the widow harris site,"Patterns of meat processing and consumption documented in informant interviews and historical sources and archaeological data are used to explain the differential distribution of the faunal remains at the Widow Harris site in the eastern Ozarks, Ripley County, Missouri. The implications of the relationship among certain patterns of cultural behavior, functional loci, and differential distributions of faunal materials for sampling and dietary reconstructions are discussed."
1985,Archaeology of the cod fishery: Damariscove Island,"In the 17th and 18th centuries, seasonal fishermen from France and England practiced nearly identical methods of dry curing codfish on the coasts of North America. The complex measures taken in cleaning, salting and drying the cod were followed with ritual fidelity. The well-preserved product was exported to the warmer climates of the Antilles and Mediterranean where it found a ready market. Structures for this land based operation were rebuilt annually, each camp requiring a vast area of drying racks and a specific set of wattle walled buildings, roofed with bark and sod or else covered by the ship’s sails. These structures should leave diagnostic post mold configurations."
1985,Glass trade beads: A progress report,"The use of glass trade beads as a good chronological marker has been hampered by a lack of precise terminology and uniform description. There has also been a profound lack of appreciation of what is in reality a large series of complex manufacturing techniques that vary with time and geography. The several manufacturing techniques can be grouped into drawn, wound, mold-pressed, fired, blown, and a few minor techniques. Suggestions are made for describing the physical appearance of beads. Suggested levels of analysis include laboratory analysis, historical analysis, and cultural analysis."
1985,Drawing with chemicals,"Treatment of photographs with an etch-bleach solution results in images with the appearance of line drawings. For very simple shapes, the image might serve in lieu of a drawing. For more complex subjects, the process will give results more suitable for artistic applications. It is also possible to manipulate the final image by retaining some shadow areas."
1985,The use of fish remains as a socio-economic Measure: An example from 19th century New England,"An examination of butchering marks found on fish remains may reveal the various methods by which fish were acquired, prepared, and consumed. Once fish have been identified, they can be compared with a relative rank market index to reveal consumer socio-economic levels. The analysis and subsequent integration of these data with other forms of data can greatly enhance the overall interpretation of behavioral patterns peculiar to foodways."
1985,"Archaeological test at the russian three saints bay colony, Alaska","Three Saints, established on Kodiak Island in 1784 and abandoned several decades later, was the first substantial Russian settlement in Alaska. Test excavations show that the site has not been disturbed to any notable degree through natural and human agency. Test excavation uncovered portions of historic features and a modest number of European historic artifacts were recovered."
1985,16th-century Spanish Basque coopering,"An examination of sixteenth-century Spanish Basque whale oil casks has resulted in the construction of cultural production structure models which identify historic techniques of coopering manufacture and maintenance, predict material products and by-products, and postulate relationships among the cultural processes of procurement, manufacture, use, discard, recycling and maintenance."
1985,"Impact of mechanization in the glass container industry: The dominion glass Company of Montreal, a case study","Development of automatic bottle blowing machines during the early decades of the 20th century revolutionized the glass container industry. Mechanization brought about standardization in bottle shapes, color, and closure types. By the early 1930s the variety of bottle shapes available had been greatly reduced, colorless glass had replaced light green and amber glass, and the cork was giving way to metal and plastic closures. This paper follows the process of standardization through the records of the Dominion Glass Company of Montreal."
1985,The sorghum industry of a 19th-century cotton plantation in South Carolina,"Archaeological excavations at an industrial structure are discussed, and a number of possible functions for the building are evaluated. Using archaeological, historical, and comparative data, it is argued that the structure, discovered at Millwood Plantation, a large, 19th-century cotton plantation in the South Carolina Piedmont, was part of a larger and possibly experimental sorghum industry."
1985,The dynamics of razing: Lessons from the Barnhisel House,"Excavation at the Barnhisel House revealed the subsurface remains of a wing razed in 1930. In addition to providing data sufficient to satisfy the standard research goals established for the site, a series of distinctive characteristics relating to the dynamics of razing the house wing were revealed. These characteristics manifested themselves in five major aspects: 1) The character of the stratigraphy as revealed in various profiles, 2) the nature of the artifact distribution, 3) the extant form and contents of the cistern, 4) the site topography, and 5) the architectural “scars” left on the standing main house. Delineation of such patterns should aid archaeologists in distinguishing between structures that deteriorated in their time and those that were systematically destroyed as part of a residential site reuse strategy."
1985,Historic zooarchaeology: Some methodological considerations,"The methods and techniques used in quantitative faunal analysis are commonly misunderstood. This article attempts to clarify some of the advantages and limitations of commonly used zooarchaeological techniques including the calculation of the number of species present, the Minimum Number of Individuals, and the relative dietary contributions of different animal species."
1985,Rapid projected mapping: An alternative mapping technique for the archaeologist,"Archaeologists are confronted with logistical constraints such as time, money and field techniques. This mapping technique is one suggestion for effective and efficient mapping of archaeological excavation units and/or cultural features and structures."
1985,Archaeological notes on a California Chinese shrimp boiler,"Excavations at a late 19th century Chinese shrimp fishing camp in Marin County, California, uncovered the remains of the brick firebox and iron vat base of a shrimp boiler. Construction of this feature, particularly the absence of any evidence of a chimney, follows traditional Chinese patterns which were later modified. The boiler is smaller than similar structures in historical reports and located further from the water—differences interpreted as related to variability in boat and crew sizes and changes in other aspects of processing technology which evolved through the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
1985,Response to review of “Indian social dynamics in the period of european contact”,Orser’s review fails to address the theoretical and methodological thrust of the monograph and contains a number of inaccurate and misleading statements.
1985,"Excavations at Martin’s Hundred Church, James City County, Virginia: Techniques for testing a 17th century church site","The ground surrounding a late 17th century tombstone in James City County, Virginia, was tested to determine if it was the location of Martin’s Hundred Parish Church, ca. 1630 to ca. 1710. The excavators found burials in two different alignments and a post hole line which they identified as the church yard boundary fence. Datable artifacts suggested an occupation ending in the early 18th century; window glass and lead probably came from the church. Because the site was heavily overgrown with grass and brush, soil core sampling was used to reveal the extent and layout of burials. The core sampling technique was extremely effective, and the excavators urge its use on similar sites."
1984,Archaeomagnetic anomalies of midcontinental North American archaeological sites,"Where the magnetizations of artifacts and their soil environment contrast sufficiently, magnetic mapping can provide a rapid overview of their distribution which will help optimize the time consuming and expensive effort of excavation. Magnetic artifacts frequently encountered at midcontinental archaeological sites include iron objects, baked-clay features, wells, pits, and structural trenches. Iron objects and baked-clay features normally yield strong and readily detectable anomalies in the near-surface geomagnetic field. Hence, magnetometry is routinely warranted when the location and distribution of these artifacts are of archaeological interest. Magnetic detectability of such soil artifacts as wells, pits, and trenches, however, is ultimately a direct function of the iron oxide content of the site’s soil environment. Thus, the glaciated terrain of the midcontinent generally is most suited to magnetic exploration for soil artifacts, because these soils normally exhibit relatively high iron oxide fractions. However, little more is known currently about the magnetic properties of soil features for midcontinental sites, so that the feasibility of the magnetic method for archaeological exploration of these features is never really certain until an actual survey is carried out. Several examples from a magnetic survey of the Fort Ouiatenon archaeological site (12T9) in northern Indiana are given to illustrate these generalizations."
1984,"Combined magnetic and chemical surveys of Forts Kaskaskia and de Chartres Number I, Illinois","Fort Kaskaskia and Fort de Chartres I were two in a series of forts built by the French along the Mississippi River in the first half of the 18th century. The sites of these forts are now Illinois State property, the first being a State Park. In order to assess the archaeological resources inside the known boundaries of Kaskaskia and to locate the boundaries of de Chartres I, first seen as a dark area on an aerial photo, both sites were subjected to combined magnetic and chemical surveys. The magnetic surveys were conducted in the difference mode (using two magnetometers) on a one meter grid unit. The chemical surveys were sampled at 10 m intervals along two transects at Kaskaskia and at 2 m intervals along two transects at de Chartres. The samples were tested for phosphate, pH, and several elements. At both sites there were positive correlations between some magnetic anomalies and phosphate, pH, and some elements. At Fort Kaskaskia the survey results indicate that the west side contains activity areas while the central parade ground has little or none. At Fort de Chartres I it is believed that the fort boundaries and a possible interior building area have been identified by the magnetic record and the chemical results."
1984,Magnetometry for archaeological exploration of historical sites,"To investigate the advantages of magnetometry for archaeological exploration of historical sites, a magnetic survey was undertaken of Fort Ouiatenon (12T9, Tippecanoe County, Indiana). Comparison with excavation findings demonstrated that historical occupations are likely to be characterized by geomagnetic fields which contain a considerable amount of information regarding the subsurface distribution of artifacts. Archaeological remains which may readily be identified by the magnetic method include iron objects, hearth-type features, wells, pits, and structural trenches."
1984,An unorthodox magnetic survey of a large forested historic site,"As part of the Tombigbee Historic Townsites Project, a magnetic survey was undertaken at the 19th century rivertown site of Barton, Mississippi (22CL807). Its purpose was to locate archaeological features to aid in the planning of mitigation excavation. The large townsite area, its forest cover, undefined boundaries for individual structure sites, and the time available resulted in an unusual survey strategy. Total community coverage was achieved through paced grid measurements using four proton magnetometers, each worn in a harness by a separate operator. Interpretation and field investigation of magnetic data identified large soil features containing iron and large brick features. The unexpected scarcity of structural features as indicated independently by the magnetic survey and archaeological excavation supports an interpretation for both insubstantial architecture originally and subsequent recycling at the townsite."
1984,The discovery of the Taylor House at the Petersburg National Battlefield,"During the seige of Petersburg, Virginia, in 1864, a dwelling occupied by William Taylor was destroyed. Geophysical exploration and test excavations have located a cellar which is apparently the remains of that dwelling. Ground-penetrating radar mapped a buried planar interface in an area where excavation revealed a cellar floor overlain with rubble."
1984,"Ceramic variability in 17th century St. Augustine, Florida","One of the issues central to the archaeological research program in St. Augustine has been the nature of colonial adaptive variability and how it is reflected archaeologically. Early and late 17th century ceramic assemblages from three undocumented sites in the town were analyzed and compared using the chi-square test for significance. Observed differences in the ceramic patterning occurred predominantly among Spanish Olive Jar and aboriginal ware categories. Based on previous research at documented 18th century St. Augustine sites, it is suggested that variation among these categories may be linked to 17th century income and occupational status."
1984,Machine-Made glass containers and the end of production for mouth-blown bottles,"Between 1880 and 1920 a major revolution in the production of glass containers transformed the glass industry and launched an ancient craft into a modern “mechanized engineering activity” (Meigh 1960:25). The number of patents for and improvements of semi-automatic and automatic bottle blowing machines in this period is very confusing. This discussion is an attempt to outline these developments with an emphasis on their chronology and impact on bottle and jar production. Although this discussion is limited to containers, it should be borne in mind that similar mechanization was occurring in other branches of the glass industry."
1984,Cans in the countryside,"The mining frontier was “a curious blending of the new and the familiar, of innovation and imitation” (Paul 1963:7). The truth of this assertion is reflected in the artifacts present in early Anglo sites found in northern California. One artifact class that documents this blending of the familiar with the new is the tin can."
1984,"City tavern, country tavern: An analysis of four colonial sites","In this comparative study of colonial tavern sites, it is suggested that these sites fulfilled a variety of functions, conditioned in part by the degree of urbanization of their settings. Four sites, two in urban areas and two in rural areas, are compared by means of a Brainerd-Robinson Coefficient of Agreement, showing a clear urban-rural difference. The urban tavern artifact assemblages seem to indicate activities related to drinking and “socializing,” while the rural assemblages suggest food consumption, a probable correlate of the overnight accomodation function of some taverns."
1984,The plantation archaeology of the Southeastern Coast,"The archaeology of slave settlements is a recent development within historical archaeology but has gained substantial headway during the last few years. Most of the excavations have been in coastal areas of the Southeastern United States, principally in Georgia and South Carolina. Substantive questions about housing, diet, and lifestyle have been examined. Some comparison between planters, overseers, and slaves has been attempted. Until now little of urban Black settlements or piedmont slave settlements have been investigated."
1984,Old Slip and Cruger’s Wharf at New York: An archaeological perspective of the Colonial American waterfront,"In 1969 the removal of an entire block of filled land adjacent to Old Slip in Manhattan during construction of a new building revealed a sequence of soil deposits dating from about 1690 to 1800. Sampling of these soil layers indicated deposition during successive periods of land filling in the area, before and after the construction of Cruger’s Wharf at this location in 1739 and 1740. Old Slip provides an example of a type of Dutch-influenced waterfront development beginning in the late 17th century that contrasts with development of the waterfront in Boston, Philadelphia, and other cities initially settled by the English. Colonial American city waterfront development differed distinctively, on the other hand, from English precedents."
1984,Just what can a 19th century bottle tell us?,"Like all artifacts, 19th century bottles reveal different kinds of information. Formal characteristics, contextual patterns, and behavioral correlates to patterns of material culture, are all familiar avenues of inquiry in archaeology. An ongoing project at the University of Arizona depends on the analysis of bottles in large measure, in order to study patterns of alcohol consumption among selected ethnic and economic groups. The actual amount of alcohol consumed appears to be an individual decision. The results support treatment programs for alcohol abuse that focus on the individual and not the group."
1984,Majolica escudillas of the 15th and 16th centuries: A typological analysis of 55 examples from Qsar es-Seghir,"This paper examines in detail 55 complete or near complete, unpainted carinated majolica bowls (Columbia Plain) from Qsar es-Seghir (Alcácer Ceguer), a Portuguese garrison in northern Morocco occupied from 1458 to 1550. Base type, rim diameter, glaze type, and presence of handles are found to vary significantly through time. The collection is interesting from a comparative point of view with similar or identical bowls found in 16th century Hispanic sites in the New World."
1984,Building materials indicative of status differentiation at the Crown Point Barracks,"Archaeological testing of the interior floor areas of the Officers’ and Soldiers’ Barracks in the British fort built in 1759 at Crown Point, New York, revealed the existence of differences in flooring and fireplace construction material in the two barracks. Further research reveals that the flooring in the Officers’ Barracks was about five times more expensive to build than that in the Soldiers’ Barracks. Maintenance of status differentiation between officers and soldiers at this wilderness fort evidently was reinforced through the selective use of building materials."
1984,Nightsoil disposal practices of the 19th century and the origin of artifacts in Plowzone Proveniences,"The 19th century practice of utilizing nightsoil from Philadelphia’s and Baltimore’s privies and poudrette pits as an agricultural fertilizing agent is documented. The practice of utilizing large aggregates of broken artifacts as a percolation device in privies precisely at the level of organic build-up is also documented. Because it is likely that quantities of artifacts became deposited in a secondary manner during the composting process, the practice is shown to have far-ranging implications for the study of 19th century material culture and behavior in rural or agricultural settings."
1983,British colonial subsistence strategy on the southeastern coastal plain,"The material culture of a domestic British colonial site at Fort Frederica, Georgia, is used in assessing colonial adaptations to 18th century frontier conditions on the Georgia coast. Using Jay Allen Anderson’s data on English foodways, a model of resource utilization is proposed for comparison with the Frederica faunal evidence. It is suggested that the site’s occupants substantially altered the traditional “English Barnyard Complex” of resource utilization. Similar evidence from 18th century British and Spanish colonial sites is used to define a coastal subsistence strategy focusing on wild resources and cattle and transcending ethnic affiliation."
1983,More on gunflints,"Since the publication of John Witthoft’s important article on the manufacture and evolution of gunflints, there have been a number of useful additions to the literature that improve the understanding of this interesting item of technology."
1983,"An analysis of East Asian coins excavated in Tucson, Arizona","The Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese low denomination coins from late 19th and early 20th century archaeological deposits in Tucson, Arizona, are analyzed. Many authors have suggested the recovery of East Asian coins in frontier American sites provides evidence of their use as currency within Asian ethnic communities. Evidence for such utilization is discussed along with the contention that latrines may provide the most readily accessible corroborative data."
1983,The differential acceptance of culture change: An archaeological test case,"Not all people embrace change at the same rate. As a consequence, within any group at one time, there will be people whose lifestyles range from traditional to nontraditional. The interpretation of a historic Navajo site represents an attempt to discern this range in the archaeological record. By recognizing that not all people change at the same rate and by determining the amount of departure from traditional culture that is represented at a site, archaeologists will not only be better able to interpret intragroup variability but will be able to more realistically study and understand the process of culture change."
1983,North American historic sites zooarchaeology,"The current status of historic sites zooarchaeology in North America is examined from an analytical and behavioral perspective. This review article emphasizes the weaknesses, strengths, and potential of the discipline."
1983,"Ceramic supply in an economically isolated frontier community: Portage County of the Ohio Western Reserve, 1800–1825","Archaeologists have long considered ceramics one of their best guides to the identification of socio-economic status. Presence or absence of expensive ceramics in excavated assemblages has been considered a definer of economic class. However this is an over-simplification of the correlation of ceramic quality and the wealth or social status of those that owned them. To interpret ceramic assemblages, it is essential to have some knowledge of the economic niche in which the site functioned. This is particularly true for isolated frontier communities which had poor transportation links to centers of civilization. The following case describes the impact of economic isolation on settlers in the Connecticut Western Reserve in Northern Ohio prior to the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825. From this study, it is suggested that ceramics break down as status indicators under conditions of economic isolation."
1983,Fathoming fort ross,"Archaeologists and historians studying Fort Ross have relied heavily on several inventories written in French and Spanish which were prepared in 1841 when the Russians put their holdings in California on the market. The linear measurements in these inventories were expressed in “fathoms.” These have been translated into English and rendered into “feet.” However, a re-interpretation of the figures suggests that they may be off by 16 percent. This new interpretation is supported by an early (1817) Russian map of Fort Ross as well as the results of three archaeological excavations. Due to the extensive nature of the inventory data and its potential use to archaeologists in their study of the Russian settlements in California, this correction of the linear measurements is of great importance."
1983,Discovery of human remains from Sir John Franklin’s last expedition,"A survey of the south coast of King William Island in the south-central Arctic has revealed new information on the last Sir John Franklin expedition (1845–1848) in search of a Northwest Passage. The undisturbed skeletal remains of an expedition member were discovered and are here described. In addition, two graves previously related to the Franklin expedition in the same area are shown to be of 19th century Inuit origin."
1983,17th and 18th century lead-glazed redwares in the Massachusetts Bay Colony,"Plain earthenwares typically comprise a large percentage of an early 17th and 18th century domestic site’s ceramic assemblage. Historical archaeologists often have been unable to analyze adequately the styles, forms, functions, and types present in this artifact class. This paper presents a typological classificatory method for lead-glazed redwares that should have broad application possibilities in historical archaeological contexts. Type-Variety Approach data are then utilized with other sherd attributes to reconstruct probable vessel forms and functions. The value of using this Type-Variety Approach, which consistently treats both ware and decorative types, is illustrated with a synopsis of temporal and spatial interpretations, first presented in the 1976 John M. Goggin Award Paper (Turnbaugh 1977). Red earthenware assemblages from the Salem Village Parsonage site (1681–1784), from other contemporary Bay Colony domestic sites, and from ten 17th to early 19th century Bay Colony potters’ kilns are considered."
1983,A vessel typology for early Chesapeake ceramics: The Potomac Typological System,"A tentative scheme for classifying vessel shapes excavated in the Chesapeake region of Maryland and Virginia is presented. The result, dubbed “The Potomac Typological System” (POTS), links gradations of forms of vessels commonly excavated on Tidewater sites to terms used in inventories and other documents of the period. Although many of the colonial terms also belong to the modern lexicon, their connotations and referents were not always identical in the past. The aim is not to produce a standardized, all-purpose typology but rather a preliminary foundation for comparisons enabling the exploration of what sorts of functional variability exist within and between assemblages. The important role of data from documentary sources in the interpretation of excavated ceramic material is also discussed."
1983,Faunal remains and social status in 19th century Sacramento,"The usefulness of faunal remains as evidence of socioeconomic differences in historic Euroamerican sites is examined using 19th century cattle bones from Sacramento, California. Historical evidence is used to place four archaeological deposits along a status scale, and bones from the deposits are analyzed in terms of butchering units (major meat cuts) ranked by 19th century price relationships. The bone collections show clear reflections of the social strata from which they derive and, when graphed cumulatively by butchering units, the collections replicate the relative positions determined for the depositing populations."
1983,Pajatambo: An 18th century roadside structure in Peru,"Pajatambo, located on the Peruvian coast between the Moche and Viru valleys, is the only colonial roadside structure that has been excavated in Peru. The site, which is adjacent to ancient road courses, consists of one multi-roomed building with a shallow deposit of occupation-related refuse. The ceramics, metal objects and subsistence remains indicate an 18th century date for the construction and occupation of the site."
1983,London mustard bottles,"A generic bottle form for powdered mustard has been identified using archaeological and documentary sources. These bottles are characterized by a tall narrow square body with flat or concave chamfered corners, a comparatively wide mouth and short neck. Some examples are embossed, some are not. The history of the production of these bottles in both North America and Britain is examined."
1983,Arrastras: Unique western historic milling sites,"In Western North America during 19th and 20th centuries, lined circular depressions were used to reduce ores by gyratory crushing. These ‘arrastras’ represent primitive but effective milling methods and are found in historic mining districts as nodes in economic and resource exploitation patterns. From mid-19th century to the 1930s, the arrastra process was used and now offers a data base to historical archaeologists and others for a variety of research and interpretive approaches. The basic form, use, and placement did not change although power sources, installation methods, and complexity of associated technology may have changed. Arrastra sites were periodic or semi-permanent occupations, reflective of national or regional economics, and are ‘mini-industrial archaeological’ resources as well. Two examples are described and potential research suggested."
1983,"The recovery and conservation of water-logged goods from the well excavated at the Fort Loudoun site, Fort Loudon, Pennsylvania","The excavations at Fort Loudoun (36FR107), Pennsylvania, yielded water-logged leather objects from a ca. 1756 well associated with the fort. Immediate field stabilization of the objects was undertaken, and at the end of the field season they were moved to the Conservation Laboratory at Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The resulting year-long conservation procedures are herein outlined and discussed."
1982,The East Liverpool pottery district: Identification of manufacturers and marks,"The potteries of the East Liverpool district were the largest domestic producers of ceramic toilet and table wares between 1890 and 1940. This volume is a study of the manufacturers and marks of that district. It includes a brief history of the local pottery industry from its inception in 1840 to the present, skeletal histories of 85 individual firms, and photographs of 993 known marks utilized by these companies. This treatise is designed to provide a reference for the identification and interpretation of archaeological data. It also contains peripheral appendices to facilitate effective use of the publication."
1981,"Essence of Peppermint, a history of the medicine and its bottle","Glass bottles embossed BY THE/KINGS PATENT/ ESSENCE OF/PEPPERMINT have been found on many archaeological sites in North America, including military, fur trade, native, and domestic/commercial sites. Essence of Peppermint was patented in 1762 by John Juniper and became one of several 18th century English patent medicines to continue in production into the 20th century. The history of its production, marketing and distribution, and use is explored, using documentary sources and archaeological material. An attempt is made to identify the type of persons or organizations using the medicine."
1981,"Socioeconomic patterning at an undocumented late 18th century lowcountry site: Spiers landing, South Carolina","Data recovery at the Spiers Landing site (South Carolina 38BK160) was directed to the salvage of behavioral information from a construction-threatened, undocumented site which was ceramically datable to the turn of the late 18th/early 19th century. Research focused on the discovery of socioeconomic patterns associated with the occupation. Prehistoric components represented at the site included Archaic, Woodland and Mississippian periods. Analysis of faunal, floral, ceramic and structural remains associated with the historic component indicates that the site reflects a domestic occupation by low-status persons. Archival and documentary evidence strongly suggests that the site was a slave cabin on Fountainhead plantation, a part of property owned by Colonel Robert McKelvey. By 1850 the property as a whole was a small, multicommodity production unit with a focus on subsistence-level agriculture and livestock raising. The Spiers Landing site is seen as an example of low-status occupation against which other small historic surface artifact scatters can be compared in order to develop a series of distributional patterns by which low-status Afro-American and Euro-American sites of the colonial and antebellum periods can be archaeologically defined."
1981,Chalmette National Historical Park: A remote sensing project,"Using Chalmette National Historical Park as the area of interest, three types of imagery (black-and-white, color-infrared, and multispectral) were evaluated as to their utility in detecting features of importance to anthropologists and cultural resource managers."
1981,"The importance of the hacienda in 19th century Otumba and Apan, Basin of Mexico","One way to evaluate the importance of a settlement type is to look at its changing proportions in relation to other settlement types. This essay examines the relationships between the ciudad, villa, pueblo, barrio, estatión ferrocarril, hacienda, rancho, ranchería, and venta sites in two political jurisdictions in the northeastern Basin of Mexico between about 1570 and 1930. Focusing especially on the 19th century, these relationships demonstrate quantitatively the rise of the classic Central Mexican hacienda in the late 18th century and its decline in the early 20th century. The differential increase and decline of hacienda numbers, and of other settlement types, in several ecological zones is shown to reflect major political and geographical events. It is argued that the success or failure of these events between the early 17th and early 20th centuries helps explain the proportional fluctuations observed."
1981,Historical archaeology in Yucatan: A preliminary framework,"There is a growing interest in the historical archaeology of Latin America, a discipline which until recently has received little attention. Given the enormous quantities of source materials and physical remains, as well as the diverse historic and cultural backgrounds of different geographical areas, it is necessary to prepare regional syntheses which will provide a framework for future research. Such a framework is presented for the peninsula of Yucatan, in Mexico. Included are a delineation of the major chronological periods, a classification of archaeological site types and a synthesis of source materials."
1981,Historical and archaeological evidence of 19th century fever epidemics and medicine at Hudson’s Bay Company’s Fort Vancouver,"During the Hudson’s Bay Company’s occupation of Fort Vancouver in the Pacific Northwest, fevers in epidemic proportions occurred intermittently throughout the late 1820s and early 1830s, severely affecting the Company’s employees, operations, and aboriginal population."
1981,Caring for artifacts after excavation—Some advice for archaeologists,"As the concern for long-term curation of artifacts grows in the United States, more responsibility will fall on the archaeologist and the laboratory assistant to provide adequate care for artifacts during and after excavation. In this article various systems are presented for packing and storing the range of artifacts found on historic sites in North America. A list of suppliers of some materials mentioned in the text is included."
1981,Habitation sites in the Papaloapan estuarine delta: Locational characteristics,"Intersite and intrasite settlement patterns in the Lower Papaloapan River Basin, Veracruz, Mexico, provide the basis for a descriptive model of habitation location in estuarine deltaic swamps in Mesoamerica. The model considers environmental and ecological factors that shaped some aspects of settlement patterns. Data used in the study include distributions of prehistoric sites as revealed through examination of aerial photographs as well as though field survey, 19th century occupations and recent rural habitations."
1981,The recycled pots and potsherds of Spain,"The Romans and their cultural heirs, the Byzantines, devised a method for using discarded amphorae in vaulting large buildings, which they each followed in eastern and southern Spain as well as in Italy. In the same Iberian regions, Spanish medieval masons continued incorporating used earthenwares into some edifices, but the reasoning behind the practice, the way in which it was executed, and the kinds of ceramics greatly changed through time, due in part to different architectural styles. Through artifact and archival evidence, the method now has been confirmed also to have been current in Andalusia at the time the Spanish American colonies were being established and to have diffused overseas as Sevillian masons migrated to the Caribbean. There reused whole vessels and potsherds have been recovered from numerous 16th to 18th century vault haunches. Apparently Indian builders of colonial Mexico did not, however, adopt the procedure."
1981,"The utility of small samples from historic sites: Onderdonk, Clinton Avenue, and Van Campen","Excavations at the site of an 18th century rural residence in Queens County, New York, have yielded information about changing patterns of land use—from agricultural, to suburban, to industrial—in the New York metropolitan region. Comparison of quantitative data about some classes of specimens from this site with similar information from the Clinton Avenue site in Kingston, New York, and the Van Campen site (28SX245) in Wallpack Center, New Jersey, has permitted the tentative formulation of hypotheses about “diffusional lag” and “culture areas” in this part of the northeastern United States."
1981,An introduction to the tin can,"The tin can has played a significant role in American history and can play a significant role in archaeology. Beginning with the food can, the author traces developments in canning and can-manufacturing, and briefly discusses can shape and labelling. The narrative continues with the beer can, the center of can-manufacturing innovation after 1935. There are obstacles facing archaeologists interested in tin cans. One is corrosion; another is the lack of archaeological and documentary research on this artifact."
1981,"A Turlington Balsam phial from Montserrat, West Indies: Genuine or counterfeit?","A pharmaceutical phial of the “cello” shape, quite similar to one recovered at Wetherburn’s Tavern, Williamsburg, was found in a colonial period burial ground on Montserrat, West Indies. A patent date of OCT 29 1751 inscribed on the Montserrat phial is the principal, although not the only, difference between the two bottles. The Montserrat phial could be either an authentic Turlington Balsam of Life bottle or one of the counterfeits produced in the 1750s."
1981,Notes on unusual clay tobacco pipes found in Seattle,"Many institutions and research facilities contain donated collections of unusual artifacts which have not been described or researched. Analysis of these materials, along with the scanty knowledge of their provenience, can provide the archaeologist with a large body of comparative material culture. The collection of terra cotta tobacco pipes discussed herein provides information on such an assemblage."
1981,"Witchcraft pictographs from near Salem, Massachusetts",Pictographs providing protection from the Evil Eye and Satan are described and provisionally dated to the period of New England’s witch-hunts.
1980,Classification and economic scaling of 19th century ceramics,"Archaeological classification of ceramics is an outgrowth of the study of material from 17th and 18th century sites and as such they reflect the classification system in use during those centuries. By the 19th century the range of wares available was greatly reduced due to the success of the English ceramic industry which displaced many fine ware types such as white salt glazed stoneware and tin-glazed earthenware. The major type available in the 19th century was English white earthenware which included creamware, pearlware, white ware, and the stone chinas. By the 19th century classification of these wares by potters, merchants, and people who used them was by how they were decorated (i.e., painted, edged, dipped, printed etc.) rather than the ware types as defined by archaeologists. Using a classification based on decoration will achieve two things: an ability to integrate archaeological data with historical data and establishment of a more consistent classification system than is now possible using ware types."
1980,Problems and promises in urban historical archaeology: The MARTA project,"The America urban setting presents a variety of problems in the execution of archaeological surveys and assessments, while it also provides a promising and unique set of resources. Using the MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) Project as an example, some of these problems and promises are discussed. Survey, testing, and mitigation procedures are described and evaluated. Also, consideration is given to the potential uses of the urban archaeological resource, with examples of hypothesis testing, pattern delineation, identification of formation processes, and public education."
1980,Chinese coins in six northwestern aboriginal sites,"Chinese coins from six Pacific Northwest aboriginal sites are analyzed in terms of condition, dates, and identifying mint marks. The sites yielded 101 specimens. Two sites, Decker (35C02) and Mostul Grave (35CL3), contained Chinese coins that probably came into aboriginal use prior to 1830. Three sites, Trojan (35CO1), Gladstone Grave (undesignated collection in Clackamas County Historical Museum, Oregon City), and Sullivan’s Island (undesignated site excavated by the Smithsonian Institution in 1934), involved coins possibly in aboriginal use but problematic as to time and source of distribution. Coins from Bridgeport, Washington (surface collection), are probably traceable directly to post-1850 Chinese immigrant population. Most coins came from two rather distinct zones in China. One area centers on the northeastern provinces and Peking; the second centers on the southwestern province of Yünnan. Older coins (pre-1736 K’ang Hsi and Yung Cheng types) are from northern mints."
1980,"The plaza II site excavation of a colonial Spanish well in St. Augustine, Florida","In 1975 a large Spanish colonial period coquina well was excavated in the plaza of St. Augustine, Florida. This well was undoubtly a large public monument, and its discovery adds to the scanty knowledge of early Spanish architecture in this city. Moreover, the analysis of faunal material from the well fill and its comparison with known Spanish domestic sites permits cross-cultural insights into dietary and subsistence patterns between Spanish and British inhabitants of St. Augustine in their respective colonial periods."
1980,Coins at michilimackinac,Colonial coins have been reported during two decades of archaeology at Fort Michilimackinac. Their distribution and contextual relationships show a clustering around four buildings dating to British occupation of the site. Status differences and a test of reliability of numerous historic documents are presented and for the most part are found to be compatible with the archaeological record.
1980,Nickel silver: An aspect of material culture change in the upper Great Lakes Indian trade,"The industrial expansion of Western society during the early 19th century fostered extensive modifications within both the organizational and material aspects of Euroamerican culture and that of other technologically dependent groups. This paper addresses itself to a single facet of this problem as illustrated through the introduction and subsequent adaptive utilization of German or nickel silver as a precious metal substitute in the Great Lakes Indian trade during the second quarter of the century. While the decline of profit gains gleaned from the fur industry may have played a part in this transition, other economic and cultural factors appear far more critical in understanding the motivations behind this selective process."
1979,"The function of Colono-Indian ceramics: Insights from Limerick plantation, South Carolina","Colono-Indian ceramics occur with variable frequency in Colonial sites from Virginia to Florida. These ceramics have traditionally been viewed as having been manufactured by local Indian groups for trade with European settlers. Recently, however, it has been suggested that many, if not most, of these ceramics were manufactured by African slaves—a documented practice on Barbados during the 17th and 18th centuries. Despite these questions concerning who was responsible for the manufacture of Colono-Indian ceramics, questions concerning the diachronic and synchronic function of these ceramics are largely unresolved. This paper focuses largely on these questions of general function, using material from an 18th and 19th century rice plantation in coastal South Carolina as the primary data base."
1979,Terra-cotta tobacco pipes in 17th century Maryland and Virginia: A preliminary study,"Terra-cotta tobacco pipes similar in style and decoration to English white clay pipes are occasionally recovered from 17th century European sites in the Tidewater colonies of Maryland and Virginia. Colonists may have made their own tobacco pipes of local clay when English goods were more expensive during the several economic depressions of the 17th century. The terra-cotta pipes recovered from St. John’s, St. Mary’s City, Maryland, were analyzed using the criteria of bowl shape, manufacturing scars, and decorative motifs, resulting in a distinction between aboriginal handmade pipes and colonial mold-made pipes. The results of the analysis also show that datable occurrences of the St. John’s mold-made terra-cotta tobacco pipes bracket at least two of the major economic depressions in the last half of the 17th century."
1979,Some observations on the quantitative relationship between Stanley South’s artifact patterns and “primary de facto” refuse,"In comparing Stanley South’s Frontier and Carolina artifact patterns with assemblages from the Fort Snelling Officers’ Quarters, it was discovered that similar numerical anomalies were present in both bodies of data. A closer examination revealed that in each case the anomalies were produced by the presence of ‘‘primary de facto” refuse as a component of the site. This paper describes the quantitative effect of this type of refuse upon the artifact patterns revealed by these sites and suggests that refuse types may have a predictable numerical relationship to the whole assemblage of which they are a part."
1979,“Cash” as currency: Coins and tokens from Yreka Chinatown,"Chinese one “cash” coins are widely found in western North American historical sites and are generally thought to have been used primarily as ornaments, gaming pieces, talismans, and gifts to children. The possibility that they were also used as money in the Chinese communities has been suggested by scholars analyzing coins found in various Chinatown sites in the western United States and Canada. The 141 Chinese, Annamese, Hong Kong, and United States coins and tokens recovered from the excavations at Yreka (California) Chinatown appear to validate the hypothesis that Chinese “cash” coins were indeed used as money items by overseas Chinese in the United States."
1979,Times and seasons: An archaeological perspective on early latter day saints printing,The Mormon experience in early newspaper printing paralleled the common fortunes of the church and its followers from the founding in 1830 to the fragmentation in 1846. These quasi-official extensions of church doctrine and practice were highly effective in publicizing the new religion.
1979,On planning and preservation,"A debate among historical archaeologists concerning the compatibility of anthropological research and site development is summarized and related to a similar dilemma within salvage archaeology. These positions are then examined with respect to a third and overriding factor, the preservation ethic."
1978,The first mexican maiolicas: Imported and locally produced,"Sixteenth century deposits beneath the Mexico City Cathedral and Sagrario tend to confirm the early initiation of a pottery industry in the Valley of Mexico and also have yielded an important eclectic sample of tin glazed and porcelain ceramics indicative of the crossroads nature of the colonial capital of New Spain. Present among imported Spanish wares are examples of 16th century Sevillian, Manises, and Talaveran types, some not previously known to have reached central Mexico. Also, surprisingly plentiful Italian maiolicas from shops in Montelupo, Liguria, and Faenza presumably were rather commonly traded through Sevilla to the overseas colonies. Representative of the Far East, numerous fragments of blue on white porcelains of the Ming export tradition were recovered beneath the Sagrario."
1978,The material assemblage of 16th century Spanish Florida,"From 1976 through 1978, testing and extensive excavations were carried out at four 16th century Hispanic sites in St. Augustine, Florida, in order to delineate and define the previously unknown archeological data base (ie features and artifacts) of that period. The assemblage reported here is based on 3,810 items from 75 contexts dating between 1572 and 1600. While the primary purpose of this study is to establish the archaeological data base, in terms of which test implications might be formulated and processual hypotheses tested; inter-site variability in patterning is discussed, and the suggestion that this is due to socioeconomic factors is offered as a focus for the continuing 16th century research in St. Augustine."
1978,A canadian perspective on legislation and the role of the private sector in archaeology,This paper deals with two aspects of archaeology in Canada: federal and provincial legislation and its effect on the role of the private sector.
1978,Bottle nomenclature: A glossary of landmark terminology for the archaeologist,"Recognizing the lack of uniformity in the literature with regard to bottle nomenclature, an attempt is made to provide some degree of consistency. The problem does not lie entirely with the terminology currently being used but rather with a lack of a precise definition of that terminology. Although not exhaustive, the glossary should be of assistance to the average archaeologist."
1978,Use-marks on historic ceramics: A preliminary study,"Researchers have traditionally relied on object shape as the basis for inferences on artifact utilization at historic sites, ignoring the problems of multiple use, consumer substitution of one functional shape for another, and intensity of utilization of different artifacts. The methodology tends to posit a greater degree of homogeneity in consumer activities than may have existed in the past. The analysis of residual marks (or use-marks) produced during the actual use of an object is one of the procedures which can deal with this problem. Ceramic artifacts in particular lend themselves to this type of analysis owing to their physical properties."
1978,An evaluation of the mean ceramic date formula as applied to south’s majolica model,"Recent excavations in St. Augustine, Florida, have yielded new data with respect to Spanish majolica. A number of 18th century majolica types occur much later in St. Augustine than in other parts of Florida. Previous studies of majolica (Goggin 1968) do not include data from domestic sites in St. Augustine. Careful stratigraphic control indicates that Goggin’s majolica dates are skewed approximately 20-25 years earlier than the majolica recovered from St. Augustine (Bonath 1975; Deagan 1974). New dates of manufacture have been assigned to several types on the basis of sherds recovered from closed proveniences of First Spanish Period (1565-1763) context at the Geronimo de Hita site in St. Augustine. The presence of plain creamware was used (Deagan 1975a) to determine a terminus post quern of 1755 for the First Spanish Period proveniences. Certain types of majolica within these proveniences were found consistently in association with mid-18th century British wares that would provide termini post quem in the date range of 1740-1745 for those majolica types. These stratigraphic dates have been further verified through the application of documentary information, South’s (1972, 1974) mean ceramic date formula and Binford’s (1962) mean pipestem dating formula. Each of these supplementary dating methods has been applied to five north Florida Spanish-Colonial sites in an effort to support the new majolica dates by testing South’s majolica model with the mean ceramic date formula."
1978,"British military tableware, 1760–1830","The fine stoneware and earthenware table articles found on British-Canadian military sites were, for the most part, associated with the officers’ mess. Although each regimental mess acquired its furnishings independently, the conformity of military taste and custom and the exigencies of supply to garrisons far from manufacturing or retail sources has resulted in a certain homogeneity in the tableware used by the military at any one time. It has been possible, using the large samples from Fort Beauséjour, New Brunswick, as well as evidence from other military sites, to select tea and dinner services that were used for regimental messes during the period 1760-1830. Since the replacement of one service by another naturally did not occur at a specified time shared by all regiments, a series of four dates, 20 years apart (1760, 1780, 1800, and 1820) have been selected as milestones. Seventeen different patterns are described and illustrated."
1978,Additional notes on alternative uses for Clay tobacco pipes and tobacco pipe fragments,Clay tobacco pipes were occasionally employed for purposes other than smoking tobacco. This note identifies several non-smoking uses of clay tobacco pipes.
1977,Philadelphia as industrial archaeological artifact: A case study,"During the last three years, the industrial evidence of Philadelphia has been inventoried and surveyed by the Department of American Civilization at the University of Pennsylvania. A photographic index has been begun which is keyed to the area’s chief topographic features. Significant structures have been singled out for more extensive research by future archaeologists. Recently, recorded interviews (both tape and videotape) have been prepared of technicians and workers in industrial facilities, with the emphasis on obsolete technologies."
1977,"Forty years of archaeological research at Morristown National Historical Park, Morristown, New Jersey","The authors have surveyed 40 years of archaeological work at the Revolutionary War period Morristown National Historical Park, Morristown, New Jersey: Fort Nonsense, Jockey Hollow, and New Jersey Brigade (1779–1780). The work inventories the archaeological resources of the Morristown winter cantonments. A proposal for an archaeological resource management plan is offered."
1977,Industrial archaeology and the cause for historic preservation in the United States,"Industrial archaeologists frequently have the benefit of working directly with largely intact structures on relatively undisturbed sites. This contrasts with most archaeologists who deal with material in which fragmentary remains are more common. Historic preservation occupies a special place in the field of industrial archaeology. There is, in fact, both a vested interest and an obligation to preserve surviving industrial sites. The vested interest resides in the desirability of insuring that all important material is recorded, and that can only be achieved if demolition is at least temporarily forestalled. The obligation is to make certain that nationally significant sites in American industrial history are recognized and retained as an essential part of the nation’s cultural heritage."
1977,A study of cast iron nails,"Nails, although numerous on most historical sites, are frequently neglected artifacts. Cast iron nails are mentioned in the literature, but unfortunately they are not adequately described or dated. As a result, these artifacts frequently go unrecognized and unreported."
1977,Ground-penetrating radar and its application to a historical archaeological site,"This study presents the results of the experimental appliction of the Electromagnetic Subsurface Profiler (commonly called “downward searching radar”) on a historic site in Philadelphia. The equipment, originally developed for thin-ice detection in Arctic oil exploration, provides a field readable visual cross section of anomolies from depths of one to 10 feet under average conditions. The basic theory behind the device is explained, and its application to archaeological sites is discussed."
1977,"The Coxoh Colonial Project and Coneta, Chiapas Mexico: A provincial Maya village under the Spanish conquest",The Brigham Young University-New World Archaeological Foundation is developing an interdisciplinary research program focused on the upper Grijalva River basin which was occupied at the time of the Spanish conquest principally by indigenous Coxoh Mayan-speakers. Five important Coxoh villages have been identified and located in this region and excavtions are planned at all of them.
1977,Analysis of historic faunal remains,"The potential for inferring aspects of a cultural system from the analysis of faunal remains recovered from historic sites is discussed. In-depth analysis of cow, sheep, and pig bones recovered from the Fort Walla Walla Dump (45WW33) reveals non-functional, possibly individual, and functional variation in the butchering pattern. Butchering data indicate that cows, sheep, and pigs were obtained in butchered form; the butchering pattern at the site is different from that followed today, and suggests a cultural preference in terms of desirable meat."
1977,Evidence of early Spanish contact on the Georgia coast,"Excavations at the Taylor Mound, a late Savannah phase burial mound on St. Simons Island, Georgia, resulted in the discovery of several intrusive burials containing material of European origin. These artifacts produce specific 16th Century dates and represent what are among the earliest historic remains recovered from coastal Georgia."
1977,Brick bats for archaeologists: Values of pressed brick brands,"Impressed names, letters, or symbols on construction bricks produced from the 1880s to the 1940s may be useful data for analytical or interpretive aspects of historical archaeology and sister disciplines. As an artifact having wide range of type, impressed “brands,” geographical distribution, and cultural use, such bricks were manufactured by now-obsolete methods. Primary documentary sources for the identification of manufacturing companies, duration of specific “brands,” and past distribution systems are industry publications, government documents, and business directories."
1977,Alternative applications of the mean ceramic date concept for interpreting human behavior,"By illuminating inconsistencies between material culture chronology and historically documented occupation periods, seemingly “erroneous” dates derived from uses of South’s mean ceramic date formula can be fully as valuable as is the technique’s more traditional application for dating. Our paper formally recognizes and extends the use of the mean ceramic date approach as a tool for furthering the interpretation and explanation of human behavior in three categories: intrasite/ intrafeature, intersite/interfeature, intrasite/interfeature. In-depth treatment of the latter category considers the excavation of two structures pertaining to Fort Independence in Boston. Three hypotheses are tested and serve to illustrate the use and limitations of the concept as a tool for cultural explanation. This quantitative approach to ceramic analysis is combined with qualitative considerations of artifacts, features, and stratigraphy to reach a consistent explanation of past lifeways at the 1803–33 fort."
1977,"Changes in pearlware dinnerware, 1780–1830","Information concerning changes in style and execution of pearlware has been neglected in modern published sources on ceramic history. This paper attempts to put together changes in decoration and manufacturing methods in pearlware dinnerware from 1780–1830. Datable archaeological contexts for Fort Beauséjour, a military site in New Brunswick, Canada, provided the data."
1977,“Swedish” colonial yellow bricks: Notes on their uses and possible origins in 17th century America,"Small bricks of yellow color are often found at early colonial sites along the eastern seaboard. These building elements are usually associated with Swedish and Dutch constructions of the 17th century. Despite their frequency at such sites, little has been written about them and still less research has been conducted regarding their history. In order to initiate a study of this class of artifacts, some basic information is presented along with the limited data derived from the yellow brick remains recovered during excavations directed toward revealing an early house foundation in Governor Printz Park (36DE3) in southeastern Pennsylvania. These remains are believed to include the 1643 foundation of the “Printzhof,” the core of the earliest European Settlement within the boundaries of modern Pennsylvania."
1977,Simple methods and materials for preparing drawings for publication,Archaeological reports are often inadequately illustrated because of difficulties encountered in preparing drawings. This article describes methods and materials which can be used to easily produce high quality scale drawings with a minimum of expense and trained personnel. The methods adapt readily available drafting materials for archaeological uses.
1977,A note on foundation preparation in permafrost,"Sawdust and wood chips were found to be used extensively in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, for the purpose of insulating the permafrost. This technique was used to help stabilize the foundations of buildings which would otherwise be subject to movement caused by seasonal melting of the frozen ground and heating of the structures."
1977,Clearing up impressed potters marks,Impressed potters marks are often a problem. They are hard to read and sometimes impossible to determine. The X-ray techniques presented here can frequently eliminate this dilemma. Using these methods those questionable impressed marks can be resolved cheaply and without harm to the artifact.
1976,"A unified approach to the anthropology of Hispanic Northern New Mexico: Historical archæology, ethnohistory, and ethnography","Archæology, ethnohistory, ethnography—three methodologies within the same body of theory—can be used cooperatively to reconstruct the cultural history of Hispanic Northern New Mexico. The leads suggested for the investigation of Hispanic culture are discussed under the interrelated headings of ecology, social organization, and trade. Other benefits of intensive joint work include distinguishing ideal from real culture and testing theories of culture change. The approach outlined could serve as a model for the investigation of other historical traditions in the same or other parts of the world."
1976,The interpretive potential of glass trade beads in historic archæology,"Glass trade beads, because of their frequency of occurrence at historic sites, and because of the culturally prescribed manner in which they were utilized by Indian groups, should be an artifact type with considerable temporal and cultural interpretive potential in historic archæology. Two approaches, ethnohistoric and archæological, are advocated here as means of maximizing the interpretive potential of beads. Both approaches can contribute to the formalization of descriptive methods as an initial step in the analysis of beads, rendering bead samples from different sites comparable. In the following pages an exploration of both the ethnohistoric and archæological approaches is presented in an effort to demonstrate the potential of trade beads in historic sites archæology and to stimulate more intensive and extensive trade bead research."
1976,Italian presence in tin glazed ceramics of Spanish America,"Until recently the possibility of Italian wares present in archæological sites in Spanish America was virtually overlooked. Perhaps such bias existed because far too often misleading statements about the exclusivity of Spanish overseas possessions have been accepted without question, when in fact non-Spaniards and non-Spanish goods were present from the very beginning of the occupation of the Americas. As the pace of historical archæology in Latin America has quickened, it has become increasingly apparent that ceramics originating in Italy were commodities shipped to the Spanish colonies through fairly stable channels. However, their identification has been confounded by inadequate knowledge on the other side of the Atlantic of both Spanish and Italian sixteenth and seventeenth century common grade tablewares. Furthermore, as analysis has progressed, Italian presence amid New World ceramics can be detected on two distinct levels—the importation of actual pieces of pottery and the more amorphous but meaningful diffusion of Italian refinements in technology and ceramic art idioms. Not only is there abundant historical documentation keyed to events in Sevilla to explain the background for these developments, but the question now arises as to why more such intrusion cannot be ascertained."
1976,The source of ballast at a Florida site,"Seemingly anomalous materials reported cover a span of time from late Medieval times until the later part of the nineteenth century. They include ceramic sherds, white clay pipe stems, glass, bricks, and gravels as well as clay deposits. The evidence points to their origin in the vicinity of the present Bankside Power Station on the south bank of the Thames between London and Blackfriars Bridges. The area was a quarantine station after 1880 where ships were required to discharge ballast during the yellow fever months of the summers. The site illustrates the value of identifying whether or not artifacts in coastal or estuarine areas are of primary deposition. Ballast sites are common and their origins may present very diverse cultural contexts."
1976,Underwater archæological search with sonar,"The location of shipwrecks and other artifacts underwater, especially items buried underneath the bottom, can be aided with many scientific techniques, one of which is pulsed sound or sonar. The theory of sonar devices and several examples are discussed in this paper."
1976,Pictures of the past: Artifact density and computer graphics,The excavation of the site of a colonial fort produced a large quantity of artifacts but little else. The only data acquired were about artifact type and location of find. A computer was used to draw maps of various combinations of artifact distributions. Methods were borrowed from the engineering discipline of Image Processing in order to facilitate site interpretation. The implications of this are discussed in detail and its use demonstrated by the display of computer-produced isometric plots of artifact density over the excavation area.
1976,"The vertebrate fauna from a late eighteenth century well: The Bray Plantation, Kingsmill, Virginia",A faunal collection consisting of over four thousand bones was analyzed from a well located on an eighteenth century plantation. Many aspects of the sample suggested that not all the material present was of a subsistence nature. Conditions leading to these conclusions are discussed.
1976,"Mill based settlement patterns in Schoharie County, New York: A regional study","This study analyzes the historic settlement patterns of a region in central New York State, based on the economic orientation of the two predominant industries in the area. The analysis itself used quantitative techniques developed by geographers in dealing with similar problems, and multivariate techniques developed by statisticians for the analysis of complex data. The study originated as a pilot study, to be used to develop a large scale model of historic settlement patterns in central New York State."
1976,The coalescence of history and archæology,"The historical side of archæology has been neglected by members of the discipline. This paper attempts to define some theory and methods of history more clearly. Its relationship to archæology will be established. In so doing, the place of history and archæology in the experimental sciences is clarified. The close allegiance of archæology to the sciences established by processual archæologists may in fact be spurious."
1976,Trade networks and interaction spheres—A view from Silcott,"The people of Silcott, a small farming community in southeastern Washington, participated in six major trade networks: local, local-commercial, area-commercial, regional, national, and international. These networks are examined through the ethnographic, historical, and archæological data. Remarkably, the regional, national and international networks are best studied through the archæology, whereas the local networks and the area commercial networks are best examined through the ethnography. These networks bound Silcott into an integrated community, while at the same time they linked Silcott to the national economy via the various networks."
1976,"Jesuit rings from Rock Island, Wisconsin","Excavations on Rock Island, an island in Lake Michigan, have recovered a group of Jesuit rings that pertain to Potawatomi and, probably, Ottawa villages there. The rings show certain style shifts that add to Cleland’s proposed sequence changes and provide a well-dated ring profile for the western Great Lakes in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries."
1976,Alternative uses for clay tobacco pipes and tobacco pipe fragments: Some notes,A number of unusual uses for clay tobacco pipes and tobacco pipe fragments is noted from a variety of sources.
1976,Photographing embossed lettering on glass,A judicious use of matte surface mylar base drafting film as back light diffuser can provide an effective compromise of background and definition in photographing glass objects with embossed features.
1976,"Three lost ceramic artifacts from Frobisher’s colony, 1578","In 1578 the Elizabethan explorer, Martin Frobisher, attempted to establish a permanent colony in northern Canada. It was an immediate failure, and all 100 colonists returned to England with Frobisher the same year. The site of the colony was discovered in 1862 by the Arctic explorer, Charles Francis Hall, who brought back to the United States a group of artifacts from the site. All the items have since been lost, but an inventory and a drawing from Hall’s records have survived. Based on these sources, three ceramic artifacts are discussed, and their possible identifications are suggested."
1975,Probate inventories: An evaluation from the perspective of zooarchæology and agricultural history at Mott Farm,"Problems in integrating documentary, architectural, and archaeological data are discussed first in terms of defining the archaeological context of a farmsite occupied by the Mott family for over 250 years, and then integrating zooarchæological data with agricultural economics and foodway patterns. The social context of one unit, a cellar filled in the 1730’s, is established as being that of the family of Jacob Mott II. This context is then used in conjunction with zooarchæological data and information drawn from the probate inventory of Jacob II on animal husbandry to determine uses of animals, agricultural economics, and foodways on a family farmstead. Proportions of domestic animals present on the Mott farm in 1736 are established from the probate inventory and are then compared with proportions of animals determined from the archaeological record. Discrepancies between the two sources are explained in terms of varying uses of sheep, pig, and cattle."
1975,A magnetometer survey with electronic positioning control and calculator-plotter system,"This paper describes the instruments, methodology, and results of a marine magnetometer survey of twenty-five miles of the South Texas coast conducted by the Underwater Archeological Research Section of the Texas Antiquities Committee. Three electronics systems were interfaced and data was recorded on magnetic tape cassettes. The electronics systems utilized were the Varian V-85 Proton Magnetometer, the Motorola Mini-Ranger III, and the Hewlett-Packard 9821 Programmable Calculator and 9862 Plotter. Data analysis was carried out with the aid of computer drawn contour maps."
1975,Gunflints from Chicoutimi Indian site (Québec),The aim of this study is to introduce new criteria for the identification and dating of 17th century gun-flints. The discovery of a new variety of spall gunflint is explained and the archaeological evidence for the existence of both Dutch and French gunflints on North American archaeological sites before 1663 is demonstrated.
1975,Conservation of artifacts: A question of survival,"Archaeological materials recovered from earth or water have become altered physically, chemically, or biologically through time and intereaction with their burial surroundings, and are likely to need conservation treatment. Conservation is the treatment of artifacts by physical or chemical methods to arrest deterioration, prevent further degradation, and restore to something approaching the original appearance and condition. Treatments should be carried out by trained persons, but all those who deal with artifacts should seek an understanding of deterioration processes and conservation methods."
1975,On the origins of gunspalls,"Gunflints are of particular interest to historical archaeologists. One process of manufacture involved the wedge-shaped gunspall, which has been attributed to a Dutch origin, and is dated between 1650 and 1770. Upon examination, the argument for the Netherlands as the source is not substantiated."
1975,The enigma of the Phoenix button,"Phoenix buttons which were produced for the uniforms of the army of King Christophe of Haiti became popular trade items for the Northwest Coast Indians around 1830. When found on archaeological sites, they serve as good time markers. Discussed in this paper are the origin, manufacture, and the method by which the buttons entered the Indian trade."
1975,Mission-oriented agencies: Means and ends of historic sites archæology,"Historical archaeology conducted for mission-oriented agencies is usually undertaken with specific objectives of developmental research in mind. The question is raised concerning the validity of having academic institutions, which traditionally operate with different objectives, contract this research as opposed to agencies developing in-house capabilities to undertake these kinds of research problems. The problems of both approaches are briefly discussed."
1975,Professional criteria for underwater archæology,The question of developing minimum standards to establish professional criteria for archaeologists and the work they do has long been a controversial issue among professionals in the United States. The presently burgeoning field of underwater archaeology faces the same problem with the added difficulty that these highly specialized skills must be balanced and judged in the context of one individual. This paper will examine in detail the major considerations involved in setting guidelines for judging underwater archaeological specialists and their performance.
1974,Tin✻Can archæology,"The original questions of archæology have been mostly answered. In the wake of this grand accomplishment, archæology developed a number of tools. These tools can now be used to investigate the very recent past. For this study, we need to draw upon the ideas of people usually not cited in archæology, including artists, documentary film makers, and urban designers. We have a chance to uncover the history of the inarticulate, and to contribute toward an understanding of man’s present relationship to the man-made world."
1974,Maiolica in colonial Spanish America,"Five complexes of maiolica are suggested as having been present in colonial Spanish America. One represents direct export from Spain to the New World and is found around the Caribbean basin in late 15th through 16th century horizons. The white ground wares of this Caribbean complex are believed to have originated in Sevilla; the blue ground wares probably are of Genoese origin, with Spanish copies."
1974,"Excavation of a seventeenth century pottery kiln at Glebe Harbor, Westmoreland County, Virginia","In the Spring of 1973 the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission’s Office of Archæology conducted salvage excavations at the site of a seventeenth century earthenware pottery kiln at Glebe Harbor subdivision, Westmoreland County, Virginia. The excavations revealed a kiln foundation which consisted of an oval oven with four radiating firemouths and a recessed airduct system. A quantity of waster coarse earthenware was recovered. Historical records strongly suggest the kiln was in operation only during the year 1677."
1974,Seventeenth century Dutch beads,"During the 1960s, the late Dr. W.G.N. van der Sleen of Naarden, The Netherlands, published a number of reports that dealt with Amsterdam’s 17th century glass bead industry (Sleen 1962–67). While these reports presented a general description of the 17th century beads that had been collected in and around Amsterdam, a detailed list of the various types was lacking. Because such a list could be useful to historical archaeologists for dating and possibly determining the origin of the beads in their collections, the author visited the Instituut voor Zuid-Aziatische Archeologie in Amsterdam in November of 1972, to catalog and photograph the beads recovered by van der Sleen from ten sites in The Netherlands (Figure 1), as well as to further research the Dutch bead industry. The results of this work are presented herein."
1974,A catalogue of Jesuit and ornamental rings from Western New York state: Collections of Charles F. Wray and the Rochester Museum and Science Center,The purpose of this paper is to provide a descriptive catalogue of “Jesuit” and ornamental rings from Seneca-Iroquois archæological sites in western New York state. Included is a chronological account of the occurrence of ring types and decorative characteristics within the geographical area from which they were obtained.
1974,"Reworked pipe stems: A 17th century phenomenon from the site of Fort Orange, Albany, New York","Excavations at the site of Fort Orange, a Dutch and later English trading center and fort dating from 1624 to 1676, yielded a number of broken 17th century tobacco pipe stems characterized by the grinding or abrading of notches into each of them as far as the bore, to form a series of holes. Possible explanations are offered, including the likelihood that the pipe stems were fashioned into crude whistles or flutes. Small rustic flutes and recorders are illustrated in Dutch paintings of the period circa 1620 to 1655, suggesting a direct expression at Fort Orange of the current fad in Europe."
1974,Preparation of line drawings from photographs,"Visual presentation of data is essential in archaeological reports, but because of inadequate funding and/or available artistic talent, too few reports are illustrated sufficiently. This article describes a method whereby good quality line drawings can be produced inexpensively with only a modicum of illustrative skills. While the technique itself is not innovative, its widespread use would be. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the technique so that others may be encouraged to use it."
1973,Historical Archaeology: Who needs it?,"This article was presented as the keynote address at The Sixth Annual Conference of The Society for Historical Archaeology meeting concurrently with the Fourth International Conference on Underwater Archaeology in St. Paul, Minnesota, January 11, 1973."
1967,The New England textile mill survey,"The following is extracted from the conduct report of a field project in “practical” industrial archaeology, conducted from mid-June to mid-September, 1967, the objective of which was the graphic recording of one corner of one segment of the American industrial past. The author is Curator of the Division of Mechanical and Civil Engineering at the Smithsonian Museum of History and Technology, Washington."
1967,The archaeology of post—18th century ranches in the United States,"Ranches, establishments for the production of livestock, are related conceptually to pastoral nomadism. If ranch archaeology is to be more than a hunt for “cowboy” artifacts, it needs to be related to studies of pastoral-ism. In the United States, cattle ranches must further be understood in terms of their ultimate Spanish origins. Various archaeological problems involving ranches are outlined."
